### Project Description: Automated Customer Review Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to collect and
analyze customer reviews of businesses using modern cloud-based
services. The system will integrate the **Google Maps API** and **Azure
Cognitive Services** to provide valuable insights into customer
sentiment.

**Key Steps:**\
1. **Data Collection (Google Maps API):**\
- Retrieve business information from Google Maps API, including place
details.\
- Collect customer reviews from each place to create a structured
dataset.

2.  **Data Processing:**
    -   Extract relevant metadata (e.g., reviewer name, rating, date,
        and text content).\
    -   Clean and format reviews for further analysis.
3.  **Sentiment Analysis (Azure Cognitive Services):**
    -   Send each review to **Azure Text Analytics** (part of Azure
        Cognitive Services).\
    -   Classify sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative.\
    -   Capture additional insights, such as confidence scores and key
        phrases.
4.  **Output & Reporting:**
    -   Store enriched data (place details, reviews, sentiment results)
        in a database.\


**Outcome:**\
The project will deliver an end-to-end solution that automatically
collects real-world customer feedback, processes it using AI-powered
sentiment analysis, and generates actionable insights.
