Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Gateway Bang Sue,Kyllian Kailo,2,Don’t bother with this location. Has mostly people that just sit in equipment and play on their phone. Can take you a couple hours to get a workout done. Other locations less crowded and seem to have people that want to work out. Feel like I should get a refund on my membership since I can’t use the machines. Everyone busy on Facebook and tik tok. This person sit like this for over 20 minutes. I want to use and ask. But he won’t move
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Gateway Bang Sue,O'Maoilcheire Ciaran,4,"3.7/5
Score is below 4 as it is not an optimal gym for heavy hypertrophy training in my opinion. There is only one squat rack/flat bench/leg press. The dumbells go up to 35kg but i couldnt see any 27.5kg or 32.5kg.
There is a sufficient amount of cables and a wide range of nice cardio machines. There are also the usual machines (leg extension/curl etc.), although I couldn‘t see any machines for back.
The 3 day free trial was very covenient!"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Gateway Bang Sue,Roman Hüppi,5,"3 days free trial + going one time possible

Great view (amazing) air conditioned and nice showers etc.
Euqipment suited for everyone so not really a gym with just jacked people but it is okay to do everything you want"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Gateway Bang Sue,Naphat H,1,"A male trainer with blue hair at Jetts bang Sue was rude to me

A short haired female trainer was rude too at the reception

Fix this problem

I’ll never use ur service again

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Canvas Phloen Chit,It’s me,4,"This review was coming from someone that has been to over 250 gyms throughout the world. I travel a lot and I constantly try new gyms. This facility is on the smaller side, but it does have everything you need. The staff was extremely friendly, they have offered plenty of drinks, Snacks, and good selection of supplements, including pre-workout, creatine, and protein powder.
This is probably the cleanest gym I’ve been to in the last year or two. If you’re going during slower hours, I would definitely come here. If you go during the busy hours, it may be a little too crowded and small."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Canvas Phloen Chit,Nat Nat,1,"Don’t waste your time calling them. Those who answered usually don’t know anything and will just give you wrong information and waste your time to come all the way to the gym to find out your understanding is completely wrong. I had to go all the way to the store to get the right answer including the cancellation and the transfer of membership. This is what happened when you put incompetence people to the job, even with the one that required only the bare minimum like answering the question.

The gym is always full and all the classes will always be fully booked. Don’t waste your time signing up."

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Canvas Phloen Chit,Shannon Johlic,5,"Very convenient from BTS. Very new and not that crowded compared to other gyms in the area. They have a great selection of free weights and machines for general strength and fitness. (Definitely not a ""bodybuilder"" gym, but I doubt most are looking for that and there are already some good ones of those out there)

Machines are clean
Weights are well organized and good quality
Staff has always been super helpful

Joined 2 months ago and love it every time I go."

Jetts Black Gaysorn Village เจ็ทส์ แบล็ค เกษร วิลเลจ,Алекс,1,"The gym itself is fine, equipment is good.
But I have to leave just one star because of one truly baffling policy.

They have a Power Plate machine – a device that in every other Bangkok gym (Platinum Fitness, Virgin Active, etc.) is free for members and always available. Here, it’s always turned off. Why? Because they only sell access for 14,500 baht for 12 sessions, each a full hour. Which makes no sense at all. This machine is typically used for just 5 minutes before a workout (to activate muscles) and 5 minutes after (to help recovery). But here, that’s impossible.

I would even be willing to pay a small monthly fee for unlimited use. But they don’t offer that. Instead, the only option is this absurd “12 one-hour sessions” package, which nobody needs. As a result, the machine just sits there unused, helping no one – neither the gym nor the members.

It’s like paying for a gym membership, and then being told the dumbbells or the bench press are extra because they “wear out.” Completely illogical.

If management explains this policy differently, I’ll gladly update my review. But right now, it’s simply nonsense."
Jetts Black Gaysorn Village เจ็ทส์ แบล็ค เกษร วิลเลจ,Patty Patty,5,"This branch may be compact, but everything about it is well thought-out — from the smart layout of machines and equipment, to the warm, respectful atmosphere the staff create the moment you walk in.

The greetings feel genuine, the vibe is welcoming, and even in a smaller space, I feel seen, supported, and valued as a member."
Jetts Black Gaysorn Village เจ็ทส์ แบล็ค เกษร วิลเลจ,Harris Sid,1,Too crowded. Not enough machines. They have more treadmills than anything else. I didn't pay 1500 a month for a freaking treadmill my dude. And the machines that are here are inferior to other gyms. There's no mirrors in front of squat racks so good luck watching your form. Staff is nice but the place is useless. Not worth the price.
Jetts Black Gaysorn Village เจ็ทส์ แบล็ค เกษร วิลเลจ,Nnevvy,1,Very tiny. No bench presses. Not much weighted plates. Not much free weights. Seems to be more cardio focused. Good gym for light weights and ladies. Horrible gym for men and weight training.

Jetts 24 Hours Fitness - Siam Square One,Alex CP,5,I got a pass for a single month while I was in Bangkok. The staff is very nice and the gym has everything one needs for proper training.

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - I'm China Town,Mae,1,"Watch out if you're a foreigner. Lied about not being able to access other branches with the one month subscription, even though the website says you can access them all. They just wanted me to sign up for more months. Then I tried the 3 day trial, but they said it's only 1 day. Showed them the website before they agreed."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - I'm China Town,Math mar,1,"I wanted to put no stars but google doesn't allow it..
I registered online for the free trial (1 day before), when I arrived at the gym I was refused entry because I m a foreigner and that the day pass is 500 baht => no thank you 👋"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - I'm China Town,George,5,"Decent gym, empty in the morning. Good amount of equipment (see pictures). Average kind of price, gyms seem pretty pricey in general in Thailand."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Stadium One,Jidapa Samphunjaroen,3,"I'd appreciate if the trainer would leave me alone when I am doing my sessions on machine. If I ever need help on my forms or how to use a certain equipment, I will reach out to the trainers by myself. I find it annoying when trainer tries to hard sell their PT package with me, especially when I was on my headphones and didn't want to speak with anyone. (Note that this never happened when I was with Virgin active and Fitness First)

Overall gym is spacious with a lot of machines even during peak hours. The place is clean. 2-hour free parking comes with gym membership too."

doesn‘t make sense to me 😁"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Stadium One,Veran “Chaī” Treerakulwanich,1,"Mostly great except for the weekend if you drive. A big warning that Stadium One always has shoes sales events at the parking lots, which occupied 90% of the parking space."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Stadium One,George,5,"Good size gym, almost empty in the mornings around 8 to 10am. Has separate changing rooms and showers for male/female. Price for jetts gym is average, you can normally ask for a slight discount, particularly if you do more than one month."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Stadium One,Laurent Demettre,5,"Good Gym with AC, all the equipments, free classes and they sell supplements.

They have a very friendly & helpful staff some of whom are fluent in English. Stopped by to just check it out and was so impressed that I signed up for the membership as well as a package of very affordable personal training sessions (especially compared to what I used to pay in the US).

A variety of group classes are also included in the membership as well as use of other locations when traveling.

Definitely happy I chose Jetts and recommend that you check them out if you're looking for a place focused on results instead of a gathering place for gym🐇 & posers."

I signed up here and paid then I was told I can not come when ever I like I can. Only come during the day, I explained I come here for the 24 hour access and was told I need to pay for 3 months to get access. I didn’t want 3 months but it was close to my condo so I didn’t mind. After paying for 3 months and getting my card I was told I would have to wait for 2 weeks for the gums billing cycle or something for my card to open the door after hours. So i basically paid for 3 months to only get 2 weeks access and no refunds were offered because “it’s too hard”"

Jetts 24 hour fitness The Unicorn เจ็ทส์ ฟิตเนส 24 ชั่วโมง เดอะยูนิคอร์น,Ben Werakit,5,"Just opened in Sept last year so this branch is relatively new with much larger space and newer gym & exercise equipments, compared to other branches. The place is easily accessible via the overpass linked to the BTS station but you have to come down to ground floor first, then either climb the narrow stairs down or take the small lift. Since it’s located near many office buildings, you can expect it will be quite crowded with office workers after office hours during weekdays."
Jetts 24 hour fitness The Unicorn เจ็ทส์ ฟิตเนส 24 ชั่วโมง เดอะยูนิคอร์น,JUSTIN COX,5,"My girlfriend and I hit up Jett’s 24 Hour Fitness recently the last time we were in Bangkok and was blown away by how awesome this place is!

Every piece of equipment is in pristine condition – we're talking all the latest machines, bars, and plates, all looking brand new. It's clear they take the maintenance and care of their gear seriously.

The staff? Superstars in their own right – helpful, friendly, and always on hand to assist.

And the bathrooms? Spotless. I mean, immaculately clean, which you don't see everywhere.

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness isn't just a gym; it's a haven for anyone serious about fitness, whether you're just starting out or deep into your fitness journey.

Definitely check it out if you're looking for a quality workout spot!"

Jetts 24 hour fitness The Unicorn เจ็ทส์ ฟิตเนส 24 ชั่วโมง เดอะยูนิคอร์น,Ten Denduo,2,"GREAT STAFF AND PEOPLE HERE
THIS IS JUST FOR THE BUSINESS OWNER:
1. Lack of equipments. And it is all either 2 in one or 3 in one.  Leg raise and leg curl. Chest press and incline together. They have 5 to 8 machines in total. So make sure you have whole day to train or only go in the middle of day to get your training done effeciently. The machines arent even good though. They are all cable not free weights.

2. 4 benches to train. Wait for your turn if you want to do free weights whilst sitting or even standing. The space is so limited.

3. Toilet. Which genius thought its good to literally have 10 personal toilets without urinals for men. So be wary if you need to take a dump. You have to wipe all the urine off the seat. Its just common sense to have separate urinals for men.

4. All in all, I think the business planner just put a gym without any plan or has never himself/herself been at the gym. It actually has great potential with lots of members coming but then none of them train for long. Its very inconvenient.

5. Its not the gym for dedicated gym goers. And the worst part is, you keep scratching your head why cant they even do simple things properly.

6. I got 1 month membership for 2500 baht. $150 Aud. It is by far the most expensive gym I have been at which has zero services. No sauna, No steam bath nor good stretching area with equipments.

So if you are seeing this post dont mistake like me and just join fitness first in siam. Its nearby anyway. I regret joining this gym, as i joined just because it is walking distance from me. I would like to also mention that though, all the staffs are very friendly and nice. They do their best. However, this issue I am expressing is just for the higher ups to make changes."

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness The Scene Town in Town เจ็ทส์ ฟิตเนส 24 ชั่วโมง เดอะซีน ทาวน์อินทาวน์,Kiatirat Apiratanawong,3,"Have enough equipment if you are looking for a standard gym at price 1,500 B a month.

Squat Rack, Barbell, Dumbbell up to 50 - 60 kg., Smith machine, Dual pulley cable machine, and other machines.  Have group class room, stretching space with several gym balls, medicine balls and foam rollers. There are a lot of cardio machines.

Not crowd until 5.30pm.

No toilet or private locker room inside, just shower and changing room. Lockers are outside at reception. No sauna or steaming room.

Free 3 hours parking. Park at the street side anytime except 6 - 9am and 4 - 7pm"
Jetts Black - The PARQ,Mahito Awata,2,"The gym itself is solid, and I’d rate it 4/5. It has good facilities, and most of the staff are friendly and professional. However, there are a few downsides that affect the overall experience.

One issue is the locker availability during peak hours—there simply aren’t enough, which can be frustrating when the gym is busy.

Additionally, there are two staff members who make the experience uncomfortable.

One, who I believe is a manager (as of MAR 2025), is a tall guy whose behavior is quite disrespectful and rude to customers. He doesn’t carry himself in a way that fits a managerial role—he acts like he owns the place, which is unprofessional and not welcoming.

The other is a bulky guy with a forearm tattoo. The way he looks at customers feels disrespectful, and he walks around the gym as if he’s the boss, which creates an unpleasant atmosphere.

Aside from these two, the rest of the staff are great—no complaints there. If management addressed these issues, the gym experience would be much better."
Jetts Black - The PARQ,Arnanthithi Na Srito,2,"I was there yesterday for the free trial at approximately 5:30pm.
Overall I wasn't happy with the experience at all.
1. The reception who took me didn't even show me around. Gave me a towel told me where the changing room was and yep that's it.
2. There was not enough lockers at all. I had to put my gym back in a cubby.
3. 90% of the machines had hoggers on them. Just sitting there taking their 5-10 minutes of rest in between sets.
4. There was not enough weight plates making it hard to do actual workouts on freeweights.
5. There was a queue even for the drinking water.
6. The first toilet/shower I went in to change into my gym clothes was fine, however the second one that I weight to change back was so smelly I nearly puked and decided to just skip the shower and go home.

So my final ratings is a 2/5. What could've been a 40-45 minutes work out lasted almost an hour because of the small hassles. And honestly speaking if I had to pay a bit more to use a disgusting toilet I rather just pay a cheaper price to not shower. I'll be heading to Jetts black One bangkok in a few days and see how the experience is there."
Jetts Black - The PARQ,KT,1,Lockers and toilets are never enough during peak hours. I have been there a few times and I always have to leave because of this issue. Which is really upsetting.
Jetts Black - The PARQ,Raul Golubkov,5,"A newly opened gym offer a variety of classes and full equipped with machines, weights, area you can spend  the energy at your choices, there are classes along the day since early morning, lunch, late afternoon and in the evening if you don’t know where to start. The only down point that might not suit all is the unisex toilet/shower where male and female can mingle around the area that suppose to be private? Just a thought but other than that. It’s worth the price."
Jetts Black - The PARQ,David G,2,"Very questionable choices with the gym equipment they’ve got, broken machines and very slow to repair, disappointing considering the great location and the gym is quite new."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness The Phyll เจ็ทส์ ฟิตเนส 24 ชั่วโมง เดอะฟิล,AC Wynn,3,"I go to this gym all the time cause it's walkable from my home but this gym is less equipped and maintained compared to other Jetts branches in town. The space is smaller than the others and can be really busy in the evenings after 4/5 pm. There's only one lat pull down cable machine and one squat rack (plus one Smith machine to substitute but I like free weights more) so it can be hectic when it's busy. The bathrooms need more maintenance as I usually see clogs in the sink and the shower drains.
But if you have time to go there during off peak hours, it's good enough to progress your training without much hassle. The members are pretty chilled and nice. The staff are okay, they mostly leave you alone, which is what I like in a gym 😅."

The Best thing of this branch is numerous of treadmills."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Victory Hub เจ็ทส์ ฟิตเนส 24 ชั่วโมง วิคตอรี่ ฮับ,Matthew Mariner,2,"Not a very well kept gym.

When I was there, supplies were not re-stocked (despite asking) while staff sat around.   It also has limited machines and only 1 or 2 weight racks, so weights often just lay on the floor.

Don't recommend."

I wanted to use the facilities for one day only, this was unfortunately not possible to to their membership system but then they let me gym for free.

He very cute. His name is GOT😘"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Asoke,Erwin De Koning,4,"I went to Jetts during my holiday to stay fit so I bought a one day pas for 500 THB.
A formal registration took place and 1 got a short summary where I could found what on which floor. The equipment is great and in a good condition. The only comment that I gave that the ceilings are quite low. Yes I’m a tall guy but I almost bounced my head during the box step ups."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Asoke,Justin Milligan,5,"Awesome gym, fully equipped for all types of training, the open air upper floor is particularly cool (or hot 🔥)

Staff are friendly and helpful and everything is maintained well.

The location is sweet and it's open 24 hours.

What's not to love?"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Asoke,Patty Patty,1,"I usually don’t write reviews, but after multiple safety concerns, it’s time to speak up.

I’ve been training here for a while and have tried to stay quiet out of respect, but after multiple incidents, it’s clear that this location has serious issues in safety and professionalism.

Just today, a 15 or 20 kg fixed bar was left standing vertically in the free weight zone near the row machine — something that should never happen. It fell violently to the floor just one step away from landing on my foot.

One more step, and it could’ve broken a bone. This wasn’t just careless — it was dangerous.

This is now the second time I’ve felt unsafe in this gym.

The first was months ago while walking on the treadmill, when a staff member accidentally shut down the machine I was on while walking past. I was mid-incline — had I lost balance, I could’ve been seriously injured. Yes, he apologized, but apologies don’t erase risk.

Add to this the ongoing lack of basic cleanliness and equipment organization:
- Barbells, dumbbells, and plates are left all over the floor.
- Nothing is ever put back where it belongs.
- Staff walk around, rarely if ever stepping in to maintain order.

Let’s be honest — clients may lack gym etiquette. That’s not new. But when staff show little awareness or accountability, it becomes a bigger problem.

The only reason I continue to come is because of my trainer — not because of the environment.

And if no one starts taking responsibility, this branch won’t improve — no matter how many apologies are given.

I’ve visited other branches and always received a warm welcome and a clean, structured space.

Please do better. For everyone’s safety."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Asoke,F344 C4p,1,"After talking to some professionals, I realized I had to speak out.

In 2024, I signed up for this gym and said I DONT need an instructor. A few days later, same teacher called me offering free personal training services. I asked him not to call me,  he sent me messages offering same service..

Afterward, I realized he was taking photos of me exercising WITHOUT my permission.

I have videos and also have his name , wish i could share but nothing gonna change :)

It’s not cheap , always very busy !"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Asoke,Som Som,4,"This is the only Jett’s gym with an outdoor area that I could find in my area - it used to be at Parc 39 but they closed down.

I’m overall satisfied with the gym, but there are things that can be better:

1. You don’t know what time the lockers actually get cleared out or if there are special privileges for those with personal trainers. I keep seeing the same clothes in one of the unlocked lockers so there is a bit of an inconsistency here.

2. The rooftop door keeps getting broken - maybe find someone who knows how to make a practical door that doesn’t break in less than a month every time it gets fixed?

3. There was a broken shower head and a few broken things in some of the washrooms and they remain that way for a long time.

4. The tissue dispenser box at the outdoor area keeps falling apart. With how busy the gym gets, I’m sure there’s enough funds to fix these minor issues.

For the price I get, I don’t think it’s that bad, but it can definitely improve especially with how crowded it gets  - that’s a lot of people paying for a good service."

Jetts 24 Hours Fitness - Siam Square One,Alex CP,5,I got a pass for a single month while I was in Bangkok. The staff is very nice and the gym has everything one needs for proper training.
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness The Phyll เจ็ทส์ ฟิตเนส 24 ชั่วโมง เดอะฟิล,AC Wynn,3,"I go to this gym all the time cause it's walkable from my home but this gym is less equipped and maintained compared to other Jetts branches in town. The space is smaller than the others and can be really busy in the evenings after 4/5 pm. There's only one lat pull down cable machine and one squat rack (plus one Smith machine to substitute but I like free weights more) so it can be hectic when it's busy. The bathrooms need more maintenance as I usually see clogs in the sink and the shower drains.
But if you have time to go there during off peak hours, it's good enough to progress your training without much hassle. The members are pretty chilled and nice. The staff are okay, they mostly leave you alone, which is what I like in a gym 😅."

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness The Phyll เจ็ทส์ ฟิตเนส 24 ชั่วโมง เดอะฟิล,Christian H.,1,They always take the money from the bank even you’ve canceled the contract. They did it twice and the machines are the real bone killers 🦴 this is not an accident ( see other comments)

Very nice ppl working out there, giving you the feeling of „we’re doing it together, you’re not alone! We’re a team!“ and also the staff are super friendly, always helping me out. I subscribed for a week during my vacation in Bangkok and this is far the most enjoyable gym I’ve ever visited ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
Jetts Black Park Silom,Daniel Wileman,1,"If you're looking for a gay gym in bangkok this is for you. If you like weights left on machines and on the floor, this is right for you. If you're looking for a gym that says "" no binding contract "" on their website but you need to sign a contract that's difficult to get out of, this gym is for you.
If you want a good gym without any of this, LOOK ELSEWHERE."
Jetts Black Park Silom,Kai Levis,5,"No day pass needed - just sign up online for a free trial and show up, tell them you signed up online and they give you a 3 day free trial pass. No fuss, no sales attempt was made. Very convenient. Good gym with all new equipment and all you need for a workout. Its inside the mall, on the 3rd floor."
Jetts Black Park Silom,Joshua Chaisson,4,"Gym is very clean. All the equipment is new and has almost anything you are looking for in terms of equipment. Lockers use codes so you don’t need to bring your own locker. They have towels but only large towels.

Opportunities for improvement: 1.) Offer small towels for use on the equipment. 2.) Add more barbell weights. There are not enough for the equipment. Kind of surprised how few there were."
Jetts Black Park Silom,Joao Campos,1,"Yesterday, I signed up for a 3-month membership at Jetts 24-Hour Gym. Today, I went to Jetts Black in Park Silom at 19:35 PM to upgrade my membership. I had my gym gear and was ready to work out. I spoke with the staff on duty, requesting an upgrade which i was already ready to pay the difference in price. The staff contacted the manager named ""Got"", who informed them that upgrades could only be processed the next day, which meant I couldn't work out.

I politely asked if could be possible to workout today and enrol tomorrow offering a deposit, but they said I wasn't allowed to enter the gym. Essentially, I was kicked out. I definitely won't be returning to this Jetts Black.

This manager named ""GOT"" shouldn't be working on customer service."
Jetts Black Park Silom,Andrew John,3,"Never seen a gym full of people that don't look like they go to a Gym.   Machines occupied by ""Scrollers"" people sitting on equipment looking aimlessly at they cell phone.   Its like Starbucks with gym equipment."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Silom Connect,Charlene Liang,2,"The staff is really nice, but they don’t speak much English. A one-day pass is 500 THB and a 3-day pass is 1000 THB. They also have a time limit on when you can use the gym, which I found a bit restrictive. Personally, I think the price is pretty ridiculous, so I didn’t end up going inside. Not sure how the equipment is, but if you don’t mind the cost, you can check it out."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Silom Connect,陈文韬,1,"The smell is very bad, and I never saw anyone cleaning the equipment. The yoga mats are very, very dirty. No one ever told me that I had to wear sneakers, it was a waste of time. The staff can't speak English, and there is no service after the membership is signed up. There are many people every day, and it is very noisy. I don't recommend this store."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Silom Connect,Иван Баркар,5,Day pass 500 thb. It's clean and fresh. U have space and different zone activity. I enjoy my experience. location next door to everything.

Jetts 24hr Fitness at Saimai Avenue,Peter Backof,5,"Great and highly recommended. One of the best Jetts in Bangkok. Fully equipped. Modern design. The huge red climbing frame also has nice, shaded lighting. It's also great that half of the exterior walls let in plenty of natural light and sun. The high ceilings are also good. Also commendable, and unfortunately not a given at Jetts, is that they also have ""pod showers."" ✅✅✅ The entrance is easy to find. Downstairs in the middle of the building, then up a spiral staircase to the upper floor. P.S.: The area between the Skytrain/BTS and Jetts is much more rural, beautiful, and greener than you're used to in Bangkok... At times, it reminded me of Isaan or lovely Thai villages, but also lots of dogs!
P.P.S.: Great. There's also a (small) Decathlon, one of the best sports stores in Thailand/the world, next door. Makro is also nearby."
Jetts 24hr Fitness at Saimai Avenue,Suthikiat Sangthong,5,"The fitness center is fully equipped and open 24 hours. The bathrooms are clean. Just bring your workout clothes and shower right afterward.

2. Few weight plates."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - SJ Infinite (จตุจักร),Pyae Sone Ko Ko (181),3,Pretty decent gym with many variety machines. The only downsides of this branch is there’s only one machine for both leg extensions and leg curls. And there’s also no specific machine for training calves. I might try the other branches as well. 3 out of 5 for the facility.

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - SJ Infinite (จตุจักร),bluefalcon5537,2,You know… I don’t expect much from a gym… all I want is exactly whats advertised. I need air conditioning and thats why I payed more for the gym instead of going to a local gym. Why would you keep the gym hot? Don’t turn off the air-conditioning… simple as that. Oh you need to save energy? We don’t care. Give us what we paid for.
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - SJ Infinite (จตุจักร),Ruby Lib,4,As good as another Jetts Fitness. Located on 2nd floor. Large area. Full all of equipments with good maintenance. Plenty of cardio machine. Not too crowded at night when compared to anothers. But the atmosphere was quite hot. A lot of fly and mosquito. Parking lot at its building.
Jetts 24 hour Fitness Cosmo Bazaar,BMOK916,5,My favorite Jett’s during my 2 month stay in Thailand. Went to 6 different locations. The girl named Nan was very friendly and helpful. I didn’t have bank account for vending machine and she helped me order with her phone. Thank you Nan!

But there should be more weight training equipment because of the member usage.

Jetts 24 hour Fitness Cosmo Bazaar,Analyze This,5,"Went there as a prospective member and toured the facility. Very impressed with the equipment. In each field -cardio, weight...- they have state-of-the-art machines/eqpt. Staff was very helpful showing around, there is ample car park -first 2 hours are free- and there is a large food court at GF of Cosmo Bazaar so easy to refuel after a strenuous workout. Almost forgot to mention it seems much cheaper than larger nationwide fitness club names..."

Fitness First Future Park Rangsit ฟิตเนส เฟิร์สท์ ฟิวเจอร์พาร์ครังสิต,Simona Meesaiyati,2,"I went in for a trial and was very disappointed for several reasons:
1.	The staff didn’t provide any useful information about the gym facilities and repeatedly referred to me as “หนู,” which felt unprofessional and condescending.
2.	Many of the equipment areas, especially the dumbbell section, are poorly maintained. The dumbbells are old, and the floor in front of them is uneven and potentially hazardous.
3.	Most concerning of all, one of only two fire exits on the entire floor is blocked by a deadlift station — an extremely unsafe and unacceptable setup.

I would not recommend this gym."

Fitness First Future Park Rangsit ฟิตเนส เฟิร์สท์ ฟิวเจอร์พาร์ครังสิต,Holden Buckner,3,The AC has been “under repair” since before we joined 4 months ago. My guess its just always way to hot. You know it’s hot when Thai people like my wife you never sweats sweets a lot. If I had better option I would go to another gym. Staff is very nice. Most of members are nice although seem lacking in gym etiquette. Equipment is adequate but a bit outdated.  Overall it’s a good gym if it wasn’t so hot. It’s the best option in the area.

Reasonable price for a monthly access ( around 1700 baht per month with a minimum of 3 months membership I think). Quite small but worth the money you paid for because you can exercise anytime. You can shower there but no towel, soap or shampoo provided. If you are not a member, my friend went there for one time access,it is pricey and will cost you 500 baht. I'd recommend Jett to charge 150 -200 baht for a more attractive and reasonable daily rate."

Can't even find my account in the computer. Please find a new branch manager
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Unilever House,Mathieu Chaumont,3,"Overall, it’s a decent gym, but there are definitely some issues.

Pricing – “Modern” Gyms  in Thailand are expensive for the quality of equipment, and Jetts is no exception. 2,000 THB/month/1year isn’t cheap, especially considering that some condominiums have better equipment for free. In other countries, you’d expect a high-end gym for this price, not one filled with Matrix machines, which are entry-level for bodybuilding. The biggest advantage for me is that it’s open 24/7 and 50 meters from home, but that’s about it.

Air Conditioning Issues – The free weights and bench area gets way too hot. It seems like only one fan is working, so you end up wiping sweat off your face every 5 minutes. Definitely something they need to fix. Maybe add more fans ?

Equipment Maintenance & Missing Machines – Some machines lack maintenance, with worn-out handles that feel like they’re about to break. Some machines are near the end of their lifespan. One bench is broken. Also, they could easily fit 3-4 extra essential machines to make it more bodybuilding-friendly, especially an extra squat rack. There’s some wasted space that could be better used. Dumbbells also cap at 35kg, so it’s not a gym for hardcore bodybuilders, more for general fitness.

Crowd & Peak Hours – Mornings are very quiet, making it a great time to train. However, around 6 PM, the gym gets way too crowded, and there just aren’t enough machines and benches to accommodate everyone.

Private Coaching – I won’t judge the trainers, but they seem best suited for absolute beginners or people who lack motivation and discipline. Nothing too advanced. They are nice and this may be enough for you.

Final Thoughts – It’s a decent option, especially since they have multiple locations across Bangkok & Thailand (Pattaya, Hua Hin, Phuket…), which is convenient for travel. It complements my condo gym well, but for bodybuilding serious training, there are better options out there."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Unilever House,Silvi N,5,"Great gym! It's spacious with plenty of machines, so you don't have to wait. The staff is super friendly and helpful. There are private bathrooms with showers, lockers, and even a vending machine for snacks. The views are amazing, and the overall atmosphere is really nice. Highly recommend!"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Unilever House,Taweerat Kairaskulapat,2,"The gym is not bad overall, but it gets extremely crowded during peak hours (5-8 P.M.), making it hard to get a proper workout. The biggest issue is the air conditioning—easily the worst I’ve ever experienced. The dumbbell area, in particular, feels unbearably hot, which makes training uncomfortable. On top of that, there are no towels available, which raises hygiene concerns since people sweat heavily in this heat. The lack of proper ventilation and basic amenities makes the environment feel unclean. If they improve the air conditioning, provide towels, and maintain better hygiene, it would be a much better experience."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Unilever House,Илья Гусев,1,"Extremely disappointed with Jetts Gym. I paid upfront for a 3-month membership, but after just a few visits I was suddenly denied entry because of my workout shoes — despite no warning during registration or mention in the contract.

What’s worse, I saw people training barefoot or wearing old, dirty, torn shoes, and no one seemed to care. My shoes were brand new, breathable, and used exclusively for training — never worn outside.

Staff refused to discuss or offer any solutions. I offered to stop using the gym and requested a refund for the unused 2 months — denied without any consideration.

This is a clear example of double standards and poor customer service. If you expect transparency and respect as a paying client, avoid this place.

👎 Inconsistent and unclear rules
👎 No empathy or flexibility
👎 Selective enforcement and unprofessional staff"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Unilever House,Fred Bran,2,The staff leaves all the equipment around after private sessions. If they are the first ones not to respect the gym how can you expect the customers to do so? It’s also dirty and many items in the lockers and toilets are broken.
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Robinson Lifestyle Latkrabang,Eren Yılmaz,1,"Dear management,
I signed for 3 months contract with my overseas bank account. After my first month I needed to go to my country urgently but before that I wanted to come to the gym and I couldn’t go in. After a while I realized next payment didn’t go through and I didn’t know that. Because of I couldn’t go into the gym I didn’t get any information. I was expecting to receive a call from gym management because they have pictures of my bank card in their system and I could do freeze my account and go to my own country.

So what happened now. After the payment issue I thought okay then which means my gym membership is gone, I went to glass bangna branch for create a membership but they told me I have to pay for 3 months now. I said no one didn’t call me and when I realised it was too late for me to take an action. They said we will call Robinson branch for give you a call yesterday but no one also didn’t call me.

I’m a foreigner in this country I don’t know how the entire system is works but I lived in two different countries for a long time when some issue is appear I always receive a call but I didn’t get anything in Robinson Jett’s fitness branch.

If Robinson fitness management fix this issue I’d like to back to training again because I’m not able to pay for 3 months right now."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Robinson Lifestyle Latkrabang,Jacy Macnee,5,"Great facilities, 2 floor so plenty of equipment. Protein shakes and everything available. 500 baht which I think is reasonable for what you get for a single visit, at least compared to Australian prices"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Robinson Lifestyle Latkrabang,ryan howells,1,"Just landed back in Bangkok and got a hotel near the airport. Was looking for a gym at 3am and found this. I didn't go at 3am as knew it would be unstaffed but signed up for a free trial as I train out of normal hours often being a competitive bodybuilder.
Went during the day and asked about the trial. Rather than being given a tour of the premises, one of the kids asked for 500 baht cash. I respect the hustle but had this been the type of gym that did day passes I would have just bought a day pass. It is membership only (rolling one month contract) which is what I wanted as I do train at strange hours. So I knew there was no day pass for 500 baht. I accepted this nonetheless, had it not been for the 5 little boys working then laughing as I left.
If you are going to try and hustle someone you can do it with a straight face not turn it into a blatent joke.

From what I could see from reception without being given a tour it only looks like a small cardio area with no proper lifting area. The staff are skinny little kids and wouldn't know how to advise on how to use the gym equipment if you're a newbie.

Went to Gym Junkies instead and will find a different 24/7 chain."

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Stadium One,Jidapa Samphunjaroen,3,"I'd appreciate if the trainer would leave me alone when I am doing my sessions on machine. If I ever need help on my forms or how to use a certain equipment, I will reach out to the trainers by myself. I find it annoying when trainer tries to hard sell their PT package with me, especially when I was on my headphones and didn't want to speak with anyone. (Note that this never happened when I was with Virgin active and Fitness First)

Overall gym is spacious with a lot of machines even during peak hours. The place is clean. 2-hour free parking comes with gym membership too."

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Canvas Phloen Chit,It’s me,4,"This review was coming from someone that has been to over 250 gyms throughout the world. I travel a lot and I constantly try new gyms. This facility is on the smaller side, but it does have everything you need. The staff was extremely friendly, they have offered plenty of drinks, Snacks, and good selection of supplements, including pre-workout, creatine, and protein powder.
This is probably the cleanest gym I’ve been to in the last year or two. If you’re going during slower hours, I would definitely come here. If you go during the busy hours, it may be a little too crowded and small."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Canvas Phloen Chit,Nat Nat,1,"Don’t waste your time calling them. Those who answered usually don’t know anything and will just give you wrong information and waste your time to come all the way to the gym to find out your understanding is completely wrong. I had to go all the way to the store to get the right answer including the cancellation and the transfer of membership. This is what happened when you put incompetence people to the job, even with the one that required only the bare minimum like answering the question.

The gym is always full and all the classes will always be fully booked. Don’t waste your time signing up."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Canvas Phloen Chit,David Gonzalez,1,Day 1 of water filter and toilets out of order. Prize for the  Worst maintenance ever
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Canvas Phloen Chit,Shannon Johlic,5,"Very convenient from BTS. Very new and not that crowded compared to other gyms in the area. They have a great selection of free weights and machines for general strength and fitness. (Definitely not a ""bodybuilder"" gym, but I doubt most are looking for that and there are already some good ones of those out there)

Machines are clean
Weights are well organized and good quality
Staff has always been super helpful

Joined 2 months ago and love it every time I go."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Canvas Phloen Chit,Eaindra Soe,1,Terrible customer service. Staff are unhelpful and talk to me with no respect. They don’t explain anything properly. Completely disappointed.
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Asoke,Erwin De Koning,4,"I went to Jetts during my holiday to stay fit so I bought a one day pas for 500 THB.

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Asoke,Justin Milligan,5,"Awesome gym, fully equipped for all types of training, the open air upper floor is particularly cool (or hot 🔥)

The location is sweet and it's open 24 hours.

What's not to love?"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Asoke,Patty Patty,1,"I usually don’t write reviews, but after multiple safety concerns, it’s time to speak up.

I’ve been training here for a while and have tried to stay quiet out of respect, but after multiple incidents, it’s clear that this location has serious issues in safety and professionalism.

Just today, a 15 or 20 kg fixed bar was left standing vertically in the free weight zone near the row machine — something that should never happen. It fell violently to the floor just one step away from landing on my foot.

One more step, and it could’ve broken a bone. This wasn’t just careless — it was dangerous.

This is now the second time I’ve felt unsafe in this gym.

The first was months ago while walking on the treadmill, when a staff member accidentally shut down the machine I was on while walking past. I was mid-incline — had I lost balance, I could’ve been seriously injured. Yes, he apologized, but apologies don’t erase risk.

Add to this the ongoing lack of basic cleanliness and equipment organization:
- Barbells, dumbbells, and plates are left all over the floor.
- Nothing is ever put back where it belongs.
- Staff walk around, rarely if ever stepping in to maintain order.

Let’s be honest — clients may lack gym etiquette. That’s not new. But when staff show little awareness or accountability, it becomes a bigger problem.

The only reason I continue to come is because of my trainer — not because of the environment.

And if no one starts taking responsibility, this branch won’t improve — no matter how many apologies are given.

I’ve visited other branches and always received a warm welcome and a clean, structured space.

Please do better. For everyone’s safety."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Asoke,F344 C4p,1,"After talking to some professionals, I realized I had to speak out.

In 2024, I signed up for this gym and said I DONT need an instructor. A few days later, same teacher called me offering free personal training services. I asked him not to call me,  he sent me messages offering same service..

Afterward, I realized he was taking photos of me exercising WITHOUT my permission.

I have videos and also have his name , wish i could share but nothing gonna change :)

It’s not cheap , always very busy !"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Asoke,Som Som,4,"This is the only Jett’s gym with an outdoor area that I could find in my area - it used to be at Parc 39 but they closed down.

I’m overall satisfied with the gym, but there are things that can be better:

1. You don’t know what time the lockers actually get cleared out or if there are special privileges for those with personal trainers. I keep seeing the same clothes in one of the unlocked lockers so there is a bit of an inconsistency here.

2. The rooftop door keeps getting broken - maybe find someone who knows how to make a practical door that doesn’t break in less than a month every time it gets fixed?

3. There was a broken shower head and a few broken things in some of the washrooms and they remain that way for a long time.

4. The tissue dispenser box at the outdoor area keeps falling apart. With how busy the gym gets, I’m sure there’s enough funds to fix these minor issues.

For the price I get, I don’t think it’s that bad, but it can definitely improve especially with how crowded it gets  - that’s a lot of people paying for a good service."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Unilever House,Mathieu Chaumont,3,"Overall, it’s a decent gym, but there are definitely some issues.

Pricing – “Modern” Gyms  in Thailand are expensive for the quality of equipment, and Jetts is no exception. 2,000 THB/month/1year isn’t cheap, especially considering that some condominiums have better equipment for free. In other countries, you’d expect a high-end gym for this price, not one filled with Matrix machines, which are entry-level for bodybuilding. The biggest advantage for me is that it’s open 24/7 and 50 meters from home, but that’s about it.

Air Conditioning Issues – The free weights and bench area gets way too hot. It seems like only one fan is working, so you end up wiping sweat off your face every 5 minutes. Definitely something they need to fix. Maybe add more fans ?

Equipment Maintenance & Missing Machines – Some machines lack maintenance, with worn-out handles that feel like they’re about to break. Some machines are near the end of their lifespan. One bench is broken. Also, they could easily fit 3-4 extra essential machines to make it more bodybuilding-friendly, especially an extra squat rack. There’s some wasted space that could be better used. Dumbbells also cap at 35kg, so it’s not a gym for hardcore bodybuilders, more for general fitness.

Crowd & Peak Hours – Mornings are very quiet, making it a great time to train. However, around 6 PM, the gym gets way too crowded, and there just aren’t enough machines and benches to accommodate everyone.

Private Coaching – I won’t judge the trainers, but they seem best suited for absolute beginners or people who lack motivation and discipline. Nothing too advanced. They are nice and this may be enough for you.

Final Thoughts – It’s a decent option, especially since they have multiple locations across Bangkok & Thailand (Pattaya, Hua Hin, Phuket…), which is convenient for travel. It complements my condo gym well, but for bodybuilding serious training, there are better options out there."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Unilever House,Silvi N,5,"Great gym! It's spacious with plenty of machines, so you don't have to wait. The staff is super friendly and helpful. There are private bathrooms with showers, lockers, and even a vending machine for snacks. The views are amazing, and the overall atmosphere is really nice. Highly recommend!"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Unilever House,Taweerat Kairaskulapat,2,"The gym is not bad overall, but it gets extremely crowded during peak hours (5-8 P.M.), making it hard to get a proper workout. The biggest issue is the air conditioning—easily the worst I’ve ever experienced. The dumbbell area, in particular, feels unbearably hot, which makes training uncomfortable. On top of that, there are no towels available, which raises hygiene concerns since people sweat heavily in this heat. The lack of proper ventilation and basic amenities makes the environment feel unclean. If they improve the air conditioning, provide towels, and maintain better hygiene, it would be a much better experience."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Unilever House,Илья Гусев,1,"Extremely disappointed with Jetts Gym. I paid upfront for a 3-month membership, but after just a few visits I was suddenly denied entry because of my workout shoes — despite no warning during registration or mention in the contract.

What’s worse, I saw people training barefoot or wearing old, dirty, torn shoes, and no one seemed to care. My shoes were brand new, breathable, and used exclusively for training — never worn outside.

Staff refused to discuss or offer any solutions. I offered to stop using the gym and requested a refund for the unused 2 months — denied without any consideration.

This is a clear example of double standards and poor customer service. If you expect transparency and respect as a paying client, avoid this place.

👎 Inconsistent and unclear rules
👎 No empathy or flexibility
👎 Selective enforcement and unprofessional staff"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Unilever House,Fred Bran,2,The staff leaves all the equipment around after private sessions. If they are the first ones not to respect the gym how can you expect the customers to do so? It’s also dirty and many items in the lockers and toilets are broken.

No waiting time for the treadmills even half of it are shut down to respect social distancing.
Price is reasonable and there is no 12-month engagement which is good for the flexibility.

The bad point is about the restrooms : only 4 showers and 2 toilets in the male dressing room. The shower cabins are pretty small and your clothes can get wet easily...
The design of the restrooms is better in the SJ infinite branch for example.
Also, the smell in the dressing room is unpleasant."

Jetts 24hr Fitness at Saimai Avenue,Peter Backof,5,"Great and highly recommended. One of the best Jetts in Bangkok. Fully equipped. Modern design. The huge red climbing frame also has nice, shaded lighting. It's also great that half of the exterior walls let in plenty of natural light and sun. The high ceilings are also good. Also commendable, and unfortunately not a given at Jetts, is that they also have ""pod showers."" ✅✅✅ The entrance is easy to find. Downstairs in the middle of the building, then up a spiral staircase to the upper floor. P.S.: The area between the Skytrain/BTS and Jetts is much more rural, beautiful, and greener than you're used to in Bangkok... At times, it reminded me of Isaan or lovely Thai villages, but also lots of dogs!
P.P.S.: Great. There's also a (small) Decathlon, one of the best sports stores in Thailand/the world, next door. Makro is also nearby."

Not sure how the equipment is, but if you don’t mind the cost, you can check it out."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Silom Connect,陈文韬,1,"The smell is very bad, and I never saw anyone cleaning the equipment. The yoga mats are very, very dirty.

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Sena Fest (Charoen Nakhon),Walter White,3,"Tiny weights area—almost to an unacceptable level. The Smith machine has weird stoppers that make it impossible to do hip thrusts. Honestly, I feel like this gym is worth at most 1000 baht per month.

The 24-hour policy is nice, but it’s not really a game changer in Bangkok—it’s pretty standard.

The cardio section is big, though.

The staff is nice, but they also try to lie about the absence of a free trial, just like in First Fitness.

Could and should be better!"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Sena Fest (Charoen Nakhon),360 MAGAZINE,5,"Jetts 24 hour is one of the best gyms in Bangkok. Great customer service, good equipment inside a fairly clean environment.

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Sena Fest (Charoen Nakhon),Cena Felix,1,"One of THE, if not THE worst Jett’s in Bangkok. Small, cramped and always packed. Barely any machines, missing basic machines like chest flies. Not worth the membership if u have to come to this one."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Sena Fest (Charoen Nakhon),Lilly Winds,2,"Cramped Space and Poor Facilities

Jetts Sena Fest is very small and lacks sufficient equipment, making it hard to get a proper workout especially during busy hours.

I also didn’t like that the toilet is unisex; it felt uncomfortable, and the cleanliness wasn’t great.

There’s no proper rest area, and you need to bring your own lock for the lockers, which is inconvenient.

Overall, the facility feels cramped and poorly maintained. Wouldn’t recommend if you’re looking for comfort or convenience"

I came before 9 am and there's no one at the receptionist. I waited few minutes, there was one guy. I told him I had appointment to use the scale today at 9 am. He asked me to wait. I waited for 20+ minutes and I saw no one at the receptionist. I saw him training someone. At least told me that you have PT session and couldn't accommodate me to use the scale.

On the first day I came to apply, many people gave me annoying and unfriendly looks. The manager who applied did not have any manners. It is not surprising that many trainers lack basic manners. The manager came on the first day and was told if his father came with him today when he went to apply for a fitness fee because it would sell training courses. When we told him to try a trial first, it seemed like there was nothing but that was enough. I tried to finish it again and this time I avoided it by asking the caller to ask at home first and he said again that he was calling his mother. That is, not very polite when speaking. I've never seen this before. Many trainers don't have much manners, they look bad and are very narrow. I once walked across a trainer and didn't dodge for a bit, collided with each other and didn't even bother to apologize to the person wearing trainers. The housekeeper first came but was not very good. Sweeping and rubbing in the locker row didn't look like she was going to be in trouble. Many people who play here are strange about placing things on the seat because they are doing PT. As for it coming later, I put it first and it wanted to put it later. It's a matter of the spine, but when we went to sit and rest nearby, it turned and looked at us like it was after a cheap water bottle. Even though we sat down and sat down to rest first and were not satisfied, we didn't have to put it down later and it would still be a big deal. All in all, many things were not impressive."

It can get really busy after 5 PM, making it hard to find a free weight machine. But enough treadmills. Some people take their time occupying the machines while watching movies or reading news, taking long breaks between reps, which is a big issue in this gym. It would be good if they could post some signage about gym etiquette and encourage people to be respectful of others' time. The price is around 1700 Bhat for 3 months contract and cheaper if you choose a longer term."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - SP Building (Ari),Nic Law,4,"Great equipment, but no leg press machine =/. Very empty on weekends and weekdays during the day"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - SP Building (Ari),Harry Wray,4,"Good gym in Ari neighborhood, Bangkok. It’s located in the basement of the SP building, you can enter using the exterior stairs from the sidewalk in front of the building. Prices are a bit expensive: IIRC its 500 THB (~$14 USD) for a day pass, or 2500 THB (~$70 USD) for a 1 month membership. A little pricey for Thailand, but not bad for travelers, especially if you’re used to US / EU gym prices. It was easy and fast to sign up for a 1 month membership with cash, and not have to worry about recurring charges or difficult cancellations like with some other gyms.

The gym is medium-sized, and has a good selection of equipment: cardio machines, dumbbells, benches, barbells, cable machines, weight machines, Smith machines, hex bars, EZ bars, and an open area for sled pushing and CrossFit-style stuff. They only have 1 real squat rack, but it’s rarely in use. They have a fresh water dispenser, and they sell protein, preworkout, and supplements at the front desk. The gym is always pretty clean, including the bathrooms.

Overall, I was happy with my 1 month membership and got some great workouts in here during my visit to Bangkok."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - SP Building (Ari),Ruby Lib,4,"Another good chain of Jetts Fitness. Opened 24 hours. Good equipment. Many grouping classes. Vending machine. Crowded at late afternoon. Bathroom was available but no towel, no soap, no shampoo. Parking lot is available at IBM Tower with some of charge."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - SP Building (Ari),James Becker,4,"Pros: Great equipment. Music is not annoying and loud like other gyms. Love the monkey bars.

Cons: Staff doesn’t know anything about the nutritional products they sell, some staff not very friendly."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Index Living Mall Rama II,Fable,2,"This place smells like feces and sewage. It honestly might be a legitimate health risk to be in operation. There is obviously something wrong here, it should not smell so awful everyday. I think it is very neglectful and unprofessional to make the entire gym downstairs have to workout in a poop smell. Is this a punishment to the locals or a cruel joke?"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Index Living Mall Rama II,Rhino Caster,2,"Convenient. Eay access to the place. Parking is near. However, there is bad smell at the ground floor. Probably from the toilets."

Parking after 10 pm is free for long hours. Otherwise its 3 hours before 4 pm and 4 hours after which you can stamp at Jetts. The facility has 2 vending machines and if that’s not enough there’s a 7-11 on ground floor."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness MS Siam Rama 3 เจ็ทส์ ฟิตเนส 24 ชั่วโมง เอ็มเอส สยาม พระราม 3,Janny Parnraksar,5,"I absolutely love Jetts 24 Hour Fitness at MS Siam Rama 3! From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was friendly, clean, and highly motivating. The equipment is excellent, and I appreciate that it’s super convenient, open around the clock—perfect for busy schedules.

What really sets this place apart, however, is my trainer, Dream. She truly embodies dedication and expertise in every session. Dream takes the time to understand my goals and thoughtfully tailors workouts that challenge me just the right amount. Her guidance is always precise, encouraging, and never once intimidating—she inspires confidence in my abilities and pushes me to reach new milestones.

Whether it’s perfecting form, adjusting exercises, or offering motivation when I feel stuck, Dream is consistently supportive and thoughtfully intuitive. Her positive energy makes working out feel exciting and enjoyable—she’s an undeniable highlight of my fitness journey.

I can’t recommend Jetts 24 Hour Fitness enough—especially with Dream leading the way. If you’re looking for a top-notch gym with personalised, uplifting training, this is it! Five out of five stars."

Good point
1. Clean
2. All equipment are good condition.
3. Location

Need to improve
1. Car park!! Free only 2hours!!!!! After that 30 baht per hour.
2. Few weight plates."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - SJ Infinite (จตุจักร),Pyae Sone Ko Ko (181),3,Pretty decent gym with many variety machines. The only downsides of this branch is there’s only one machine for both leg extensions and leg curls. And there’s also no specific machine for training calves. I might try the other branches as well. 3 out of 5 for the facility.
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - SJ Infinite (จตุจักร),Ice,1,"BECAREFUL. For those who on a vacation and want 1 day pass, make sure to come in early cause despite it said 24hr, there a time limit for 1 day pass and there no indication of such thing anywhere. They will not let u in after 22:00."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - SJ Infinite (จตุจักร),bluefalcon5537,2,You know… I don’t expect much from a gym… all I want is exactly whats advertised. I need air conditioning and thats why I payed more for the gym instead of going to a local gym. Why would you keep the gym hot? Don’t turn off the air-conditioning… simple as that. Oh you need to save energy? We don’t care. Give us what we paid for.
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - SJ Infinite (จตุจักร),Ruby Lib,4,As good as another Jetts Fitness. Located on 2nd floor. Large area. Full all of equipments with good maintenance. Plenty of cardio machine.

Jetts 24 Hours Fitness - The Glass Bangna,Nithi Tangsirisap,5,"Just recently opened so everything is still impeccably new. Spacious and very bright since the whole place is directly facing the sun in the afternoon hence it can be quite hot during the day. Can be very crowded during peak hours but generally manageable. Overall a good experience, especially when comparing with other Jetts outlets."
Jetts 24 Hours Fitness - The Glass Bangna,Jimmy L.,3,"First time here and it's a nice and new building. However, during the afternoon is when you'll start feeling the heat exhaustion. Thailand air quality and heat is no joke. They need to have curtains to cover the sun from the glass window. I almost passed out a few times"
Jetts 24 Hours Fitness - The Glass Bangna,Bobby Armor,1,"Horrible service.
The staff don't know how to communicate to new customers (in Thai or English).

You'd think for a new place they'd want to get new members, but they don't seem to care.

Not friendly.  Didn't explain anything.  Just pointed to a clipboard and expected us to understand.

Then they wanted our information to register in the system.  Laughable."

In each field -cardio, weight...- they have state-of-the-art machines/eqpt.

Almost forgot to mention it seems much cheaper than larger nationwide fitness club names..."

The only good thing is that the service fee is cheap. If anyone wants to apply to play during 17.00-22.00, I recommend that you come and see the place at that time first. There are so many people that you can barely do anything. There are usually groups of people who are working out and reserving machines.

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Central Nakhon Pathom,Sorada Somwan,2,"Wanted to use the new model of measuring device at Jett Fitness, which requires a staff member to measure, so waited until 8:00 a.m., which is the staff working hours, but no one was available to provide service because the trainers were all busy with personal customers and no other staff member was available to take care of them.

Even though they knew that the equipment required staff, there was no one ready to provide service, making them wait for an hour and a half or come back the next day.

On Saturdays and Sundays when there are a lot of customers, there should be a clearer staff assignment because this is a basic service that customers expect. They should give importance to all customers, not just those who pay for personal training.

The equipment is modern, the gym is clean, but the service management still needs improvement."

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - The Fourth,Sparsh Choudhary,2,"I have been member of this gym for a few months, it appears that there are systematic flaws in how this gym is managed, cardio machines will be broken for months without any attention, I have been watching a piece of tissue hanging on a machine for months, clearly it is nobody’s responsibility to take it out, lockers are falling apart, there are forgotten clothes hanging, whose owners definitely are not going to return to pick them, there is an umbrella too, unused during monsoons, it makes me sad. Now in this state you can forget about benches getting wiped, hygiene of toilets etc etc. Met a guy who once tried to open a window and gym management decided to cut handles off of all the windows, yes, it is correct. In order to fill a small water bottle you need to standing for at least 5 minutes on water cooler, may be it is doing some kind of triple or quadruple filtering, or most likely it is broken. I don’t think this is staff issue, they all seem professional but there is an element of structural management which seems to be missing in this gym. I hope one day someone who is equipped to fix these issues will read this review."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - The Fourth,Polina Shemetova,1,"Honestly it was the worst gym experience in Bangkok I have in half a year.
500 baht for daily pass and they understand nothing in English. Also they will not give you a lock for a box. And it will take a minimum of 10 minutes to get in a gym, because they understand nothing and ask you to fill out some form about you (for a hour training lol). I came to check if I want to take a month pass. No thank you.

Of course I understand that no one have to know English in Thailand. But it is a joke then that they have a motivational quotes and navigation signs inside the gym in English only lol"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - The Fourth,holynectar,1,"[edited2] Now I’ve been spending 10months with this branch and I guaranteed that none of the comments below have been fixed! Unbelievable!!! The toilet stinks from miles away. The air con poorly working in these hot days. And a Smith Machine has been broke for weeks without any sign of it getting fixed soon! What a poor management! What these staffs do is contrast to these problems, they still selling cheap and sus promotion in a FB group. Like they focus on a new comers more than us, who is their loyal customer. What a weird marketing! Smh.

The only thing ppl stick with this gym is that it is the only commercial gym around the area. I can’t wait for the new gym to open, ppl won’t choose this low-tier place for sure.

I've been a member since the first day this branch open in June. It's 4 months now and things just got worse and worse. I do not know what the management team is doing or what is wrong with The Fourth branch, but the place is F up. First of all, the plate is unorganized and scattered around 2nd floor. If you are unlucky, you will have to dig into a big pile of heavy plates before getting the one you wanted which is frustrating and tiring. I'm not saying it is all the staff's fault, but at least once a week the plate should be rearrange (IMO). Second, what the F is up with the AC? The place is so hot comparing to other branch (I usually workout at 8pm and yes, it still hot af). The AC in the workout area (both floor) is so hot making the atmosphere not suitable for you to enjoy your time there. Unlike the bathroom and locker area, the weather so nice I would love to do bench press there lol. However, I would not complain about the dirty and untidy bathroom as I already saw someone talked about that already haha. Also, get your staff some education and improve their manners, I understand being a trainer your client is very important. But that doesn't mean you could take someone's equipment when they are using it and give it to your client. Thats a nasty and disgusting behavior. Lastly, I really recommend the team to look over this problem seriously, as I am one of the members that think the brand itself is cool. Just lack of good management skill from the right person and it is affecting your image."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - The Fourth,KOKO,2,"As a current fitness member of this place, I know that this place isn’t so good compared to other Jetts. Many machines kept broken and no one bothered to replace or even check for maintenance. The place is so fully packed in the afternoon since it is too small and some equipments are not prepared well. But I have to keep on coming here since it is the only place around here."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - The Fourth,Naing Moe,2,"Brandnew just open but already in a really bad shape. Bathrooms are quite dirty, staffs are just always standing around and in the way of workout space, weights are always racked awkwarly so when you want heavy plates, you have to go diggingin a pile that don't belong there, and organization just aint there. Overall maintenance don't seems to be there at all neither. It looks and feel good now because its brand new now but i dont expect this place to be the same in about 6 months unless management takes a hard look at what's going there. Also please someone wipe down those benches."

And entering a class with a teacher (some classes) will not interest new people. Because the new person couldn't keep up. I'll talk more with old people who are already regulars because it's easy to teach. Teacher is more comfortable And some classes have locks for regulars. The last thing is the bathroom. The smell is very strong. Almost every room is like this every time I go. I don't know what the cause is. The player is not cleaned. There was a day when I ran out of tissues and asked the housekeeper, ""I'm sorry, do you have any tissues?"" and got annoyed and said, ""No!"" The only good thing left is that it's open 24 hours."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Central Phuket,Alexander Romanov,5,"It has everything for a good workout. Lots of machines, mostly old Matrix.

Weird pec deck that is hardly usable, and lots of equipment that feels outdated and strange, but it still pretty decent gym with good AC and showers. Two racks of dumbbells, multiple barbells, cage barbell. Areas for stretching, boxing, yoga — everything you may expect from a large fitness center. They also offer devices for relaxation of your legs and many other massage devices in additional subscription.

The whole process of signing up for 1 month pass took me about 7 minutes. However, short term pass is just a printed out piece of paper, so you are limited to staffed hours to go to the gym (8AM to 8PM)."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Central Phuket,Marco Govoni,4,"Staff is very friendly. Update on price it is now 2500BATH per month on low season, although it is a higher price compared to 6-12 months ago it is a very cool and clean gym. It has 3 sets up equipment for most exercises like lat machines, squat racks, 2 sets of cables and 2 separate joint cables. Has a lot of cardio equipment and for girls they also do a bunch of classes. If the price was lower like 1800BATH on low season I would have gave it 5 stars cause everything else is perfect."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Central Phuket,Kingken130,5,Amazing gym. Been using this place for 5 years. Great personal trainers too
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Central Phuket,Beatrise,4,"Great gym if you’re staying nearby, had all the equipment I needed to train cardio and resistance. Big bonus were the monkey bars. Offers protein for a good price. One time pass is 500thb. The only downside that the staff was not always at the counter and I had to wait 10 minutes until someone came over. Will come again when in the area"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Central Phuket,Nicholas scott,1,Never been to a gym that won’t let you look around without  stealing all your info through phone scan. Never did but I presume the  gym meets the attitude of the company and reception staff……… poor! There is an alpha gym just up the road from it and that really is pleasant.
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Robinson Lifestyle Thalang,Mike,1,I bought a one month gym membership and got kicked out within an hour because I didn't want a gay national man on trt putting his head and phone near my butt. According to him disengaging in homosexual behavior is against the constitution.
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Robinson Lifestyle Thalang,Kimberly Crystal Fernando Pragados,4,I love the locker and toilet also the equipments but I wish they planned well where to put the equipments where is the mirror is located. Plus please put a reminder to all the customers to know how to clean and put back the equipments they use after as its chaotic.

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Robinson Lifestyle Thalang,Oldooz Mehrfar,1,"We have been registered in this gym for two months, but we no longer intend to continue exercising in this gym, and I will not go to this gym again. Today, a Thai man tried to forcefully take my husband turn at the machine and started saying bad words and swearing ,cursing and disrespecting him , and tried to attack him , We didn't want to fight with this person, so we informed the staff there. Unfortunately, the staff of this gym did nothing for us, I do not recommend this gym to anyone. Because there are no rules in this gym, and when you pay the fee, the management and staff do not accept any responsibility."

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Index Living Mall Chiang Mai,Ploy Wang,3,"This is a good gym with a dangerous design. The staff is friendly and energetic. Some of the trainers here are good. Nice AC.  Everything is new.  However, the positioning of the squat racks and bench presses are closely dangerous.  The double cable pulley adjustable machine is dangerously positioned behind a squat rack and against a wall.  There is only 4- 7 inches between each barbell. Who ever designed this gym did NOT take into consideration international fitness safety standards and protocols.  Eventually, somebody is going to get injured until the equipment is moved apart at a safe distance."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Index Living Mall Chiang Mai,Pazz,2,"I come to this gym looking for a trainer.   Good gym nice cold AC. But, trainer is very lazy and she only sits and plays with her phone while my friend is being trained by her.   Jett’s please manage your trainers.    Your equipment is too close together.  Somebody is going to get hurt in your gym."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Index Living Mall Chiang Mai,จินดาสา นามสมมุติ,3,"Extremely overpriced for what your getting. I have been to gyms half this price with better equipment, steam rooms, sauna, towel service and more.  Very expensive for Thailand obviously catering towards a specific clientele.  Not the greatest gym if you lift heavy or are a body builder. Good for fitness and cardio mostly."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Index Living Mall Chiang Mai,Emilyy Flockhart,3,Nice air conditioned gym however other reviews stand correct about how dangerously close some gym equipment is. The water dispensers are also never cold. The gym is good though but the positioning of equipment can be redesigned a lot better.
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Index Living Mall Chiang Mai,tosya bosya,3,"The jym floor is dirty,  even early morning.  And the huge  windows facing sunlight needs shades,  the AC is not enough."

Free water dispensers and showers.

I like that it's open 24 hours, perfect for those who work late but still want to exercise. There are also stretching machines with instructions posted."

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Central Si Racha,Gangwoo Cho (Jun),3,"I start my day at Jett’s every morning at 5:50 AM.

As someone who prefers early morning workouts, this gym fits me perfectly.
It’s quiet, never crowded, and the atmosphere is ideal for focusing on my training.
The equipment is always well-maintained and kept very clean, which gives me confidence in using it.

What impressed me the most was seeing members voluntarily clean the machines after use.
After seeing that, I naturally started doing the same — now I always wipe down the equipment after I finish.
This kind of culture is rare and leaves a very positive impression.

The showers are clean, the lockers are spacious, and overall, the facility is well-organized and pleasant.
The best part? It’s open 24/7!
I don’t have to worry about the time and can train freely according to my own schedule — that’s a huge advantage.

If there’s one small downside, it’s that the staff can sometimes come across as a bit stiff or overly formal.
If they could greet members with warmer smiles and a friendlier attitude,
this gym could become more than just a place to work out — it could feel like a truly welcoming space."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Central Si Racha,Ploy Wang,2,"Good gym.  This gym is also a playground for children for free no gym membership is necessary.  The instructor helps the kids set up the equipment for play time while mother exercises.  Unfortunately, the adults will have to exercise in a different area today.  Management please designate an isolated area where children will not get injured."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Central Si Racha,Morocco L,1,"Terrible service. What a waste of money. Going to another gym would be so much better. I feel so disappointed and will definitely not be renewing my membership here.
The service is poor, and the staff's communication and attitude are unprofessional. They don't take care of or pay attention to customers at all. It doesn't have the premium feel that was advertised. Before I signed up, they were very nice, but after I paid, it was a complete 180-degree change. Awful.

Stay far away from this place😒"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Central Si Racha,Apinan Ch (Amp),5,New gym new machines. Staffs are really nice. Environment is so good.
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Central Si Racha,Paripat Pairat,5,The best gym in Sri Racha
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Little Walk (Pattaya),AC Wynn,1,"I don't usually rate a place one star but this place has a design flaw. The equipment are placed in different areas in a bizarre way and the free weight area is too small.
There's only one rack for free barbell exercises which can cause a lot of stress for the members. In other Jetts gyms in Bangkok, there's always one squat rack, one bench press bench, one inclined bench and one reverse inclined bench with one barbell in each rack/bench. So four people can train at the same time if they're doing different lifts. But in this gym, everyone who wants to use a barbell needs to compete with each other for this one rack no matter what lift they wanna do.
It's more bizarre cause this gym is even bigger than some Jetts gyms in Bangkok. There's even a big monkey bar area that nobody seems to use. I hope they bring in more barbell benches. Otherwise, I can't even imagine how people navigate this in peak hours."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Little Walk (Pattaya),Mini Malist,1,"I would like to share my first experience with this company before even able to  become a member. The first person i interact with was a man, who could be a trainer there or a receptionist.  I went there certainly to experience well feeling of the workout environment moreover the customer service as well as pleasantness is for myself crucial to become a member.

But just let's to the point. The first interaction i got from him was discussing about monthly price, which the amount is being distinguished by the company in the way you pay. Either by hand monthly payment which is 1,700 Bath, or a direct debit with minimum 3 months in advance which you will get minimal advantage.
Now, for me personally the price is not the issue. It's just the thing that i haven't got the chance to learn the profile of this place.

Well, i have no clue how is the service quality here more over the professionalism content of this place by the way.
And by delivering me this first impression about price information, wouldn't definitely build the positive customer credibility. In other short word poor customer interaction skill.

I was than lead to walk around the workout area, which is not big and simple. No healthy conversation, rather i have to ask questions if i want to know something. So far.
It won't take me more than 2 minutes to discover what they have to offer there. And finally the last question i got before leaving the place was ""when do you want to be a member  ?"". Okay.. well that's hilarious as  i now for sure know that he has no idea what i value whether i am interested in becoming a member or not after all this first experience. Not even a question i deserve. Poor customer centric.

Anyway, i don't blame rather than want share that it's not the customer confidence but the discomfort feeling grows in me after all this demonstration of direct lead conversion and poor value proposition strategic. I mean should i pay for the unknown quality or unknown quantity ?.
I decide not to get involved more experience here. Because i just doubt that i would get better customer support in this place."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Little Walk (Pattaya),Lilly Winds,4,"The staff at Jetts Fitness are friendly and approachable, which makes the environment feel welcoming.

However, the gym gets extremely crowded between 5–7 PM, and there aren’t enough machines or equipment to accommodate everyone during that time. Best to avoid peak hours"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Little Walk (Pattaya),Apinan Ch (Amp),2,"Gym is a little bit old compared to other locations . Machines are old and some was broken without fixing for long time. Staffs are not professionals and no service mind.

1 thing that better than other gym is 24 hrs availability."

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Market Village Hua Hin,Mathieu Chaumont,4,"I’m a Jetts member in Bangkok and was able to enter this branch by simply scanning my card — no issues at all. It’s great to enjoy the convenience of the Jetts network without any hassle.

As for the gym itself, I only visited twice during my short stay in Hua Hin, but here’s what I can say: it’s well located inside Market Village, not too crowded — even at peak time around 7 PM, which is nothing like the busier Jetts locations I know in the capital. The machines are exactly the same as in other branches, although the leg curl/leg extension machine was unfortunately out of order during my visit.

There’s also a nice open area inside, which I imagine is used for group classes. Overall, the gym meets the same standards I’m used to from Jetts. I would guess there are probably more tourists who come for single sessions here, but personally, I didn’t notice any during my visits."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Market Village Hua Hin,Neo Lithic,5,"Great little gym at the back end of the Village Market on the main Street in Hua Hin.  It's on the 3rd floor FYI.  They offer memberships but as a traveler it doesn't make much sense to join so they also offer pay by the day, however it's very expensive IMHO.  They ask 500 Baht per day for one visit, it 1000 Baht for 3 days.  And they don't take cash, which I didn't know before I went and didn't have a card with me.  But the sweet girl working the desk let me know that as a first-time customer I was entitled to one free trial workout!   So I got my workout in and all was good.  It's not real big but it's clean and has all the basics, and I prefer smaller gyms anyway so I liked it just fine."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Market Village Hua Hin,Eksiri Jarurungson,3,"Located in the 3rd floor of Market Village, around Major cineplex area (Theater)

Facility, a bit small especially weight training area. For machine and cardio functions also not enough on the peak period (6pm onward)

Air condition, quite ok.

Overall, i think this gym is good for workout. Especially opening 24/7!!!!"
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Market Village Hua Hin,M C,3,"A gym for untrained people. Lots of trainers lying all over the floor giving massages. And muay thai boxing in the middle of the weight training area so it's noisy for everyone. There's not enough space for the equipment they have because there are too many cardio machines that aren't being used. And then there are problems with the air conditioning, suddenly it's become very hot, many people come there only because it's the gym in all of Hua Hin with the lowest temperature but no more. But it's a gym where the staff are friendly and smiling and there's lots of good professional equipment and good prices. I highly recommend it if you're a beginner."
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Market Village Hua Hin,Jessie James,5,This place is huge.  They have different programs everyday.  Located at the top of the market village huahin. Accessible and surrounded by shops and stalls. Nice Zumba instructor.   Very energetic and lively.

(This is confusing, since I’m canceling because I won’t be using it in August.)

When I asked the staff, they just said, “It’s the process.”"
We Fitness,MJ,5,"Let me tweak my review, lift the bar to 5 star, Gym is Great and the classes are outstanding. They'll do absolutely great job with happy face.

WE fitness has decent variety of equipment, But how they consult for membership is something they need to step up. Thought 2300 baht for this expensive but for the class its worth it. Highly recommended. Give a try."

The body scan machines were state of the art. The staff was friendly and courteous. Wish there was a larger dumbbell section, but that was the only thing I would change. The entrance directly from the BTS is so easy. Loved this place!"
WE Fitness Ekkamai,pori tan,4,"Offer many variety of classes.   Brand name instruments.   Yoga classes quite popular here and always fully booked.  Recommend to reserved all classes in advanced.

It would be nice if they consider to renovate the shower rooms.  It’s a bit dirty and some shower door were too transparency."
WE Fitness Ekkamai,Corey Ettía,3,"Standard gym set up, has everything you need but i would look around as there are much more better equipped facilities at a cheaper price.
700 bht is more than i pay back in a Australia and we have some world class gyms"
WE Fitness Ekkamai,Matthew Raab,1,"Where to begin with this gym?  When you first walk in you'll be greeted by some robots.  Then you'll encounter a bunch of trainers standing around awkwardly trying to intimidate you into purchasing personal training.  It becomes clear that it's the business model to over hire personal trainers as they make the most money this way to a point where there are so many trainers they can outnumber customers at the gym.

Bottom line is that many people are leaving this gym because this gym doesn't care about you but instead only trying to squeeze more money from you.  Think carefully before engaging in a contract."
WE Fitness Ekkamai,Rick Ray (RickRayFX),4,"Great value for money! Same equipment as other more expensive gyms. Under $40 per month, just bring your own towel. Easy location, next to BTS Ekamai."
WE Fitness Esplanade Ratchada,Naw Hsu Ei Thin Zar (kk),4,"WE Fitness is located inside the shopping mall called Esplanade, a 2-minute walk from Thailand Cultural Center MRT station. As a member of WE Fitness, I enjoy working out here. The sales staff are always welcoming with warm smiles. The changing room is clean and hygienic. The fitness equipments are pretty enough to share with other members. But the equipments are not updated as they should be. If you want PT, there are a lot of gym trainers (male/female) you can choose from."
WE Fitness Esplanade Ratchada,Sebastian,1,Got handed a 3 day free membership. When I finally got to the place the next day they refused to let me workout. I should have called before to tell them I was coming they said. Even though I had gotten zero information about that earlier.
WE Fitness Esplanade Ratchada,TR O.,1,"Poor service no service mind .The staff talks and tries to sell only a 1 year contract.  If ํyou want to workout like a professional or need a good vibes and nice environment  I'm not sure to recommended.
I'm not very impressed with the attempt to sell the course.  If you can pay a little more I recommend FF or Virgin. THANK YOU"
WE Fitness Esplanade Ratchada,Ros C.,3,"NOT WORTH IT.
Good facilities, trainers pays attention to their students' proper posture (vgood)
BUT the yoga class is very intimidating (bad teacher as a whole)
the SALES people cannot respect your timing for the membership and will FORCE you to pay on the day you tried the gym and will tell you that by the following days the promo is gone and you will no be able to afford it. (Person I talked to is the MANAGER)"
WE Fitness Esplanade Ratchada,Karsten Aichholz,4,"The first you'll usually see of this gym is their sales staff in the mall handing out 7-day free training coupons. They're not quite as hard sell as some other gyms, but they definitely try to sell you on a package.

They have some room to negotiate, so if you sign up for a 12 months package, you can get about 1 free months and a minor discount, resulting in an overall price that works out to be around THB 2,000 / month.

I suspect the sign-up fee is pretty much the commission of the sales staff (they declined to elaborate on details), which explains why there's so many of them as well as why any shorter plans (e.g. 5 months or less) work out to be very, very expensive.

The whole hard sell part was the main reason I was super reluctant to sign up for this place - especially if nearby gyms in Rachadaphisek 7 offer the essential weight lifting equipment at price that's somewhere between 30 and 70% cheaper than this one.

If you go outside rush hours there's a pleasant absence of crowds. I tend to however avoid 'after work hours' since that's where you really have to watch out where you kick during a body combat workout class.

The gym is nice. It comes with a steam sauna, free coffee and water and a smoothie bar that offers some okay options for a quick snack.

Biggest pro is the overall atmosphere - staff there genuinely seems to like being there, the place is well maintained and it seems quite newbie-friendly.

If you enjoy group classes and know you'll be around for at least a year, it's a great pick. If you're just looking for weight lifting essentials, try out nearby Fitness 7 (which is open 24 hours)."

WE Fitness (J Avenue Thonglor),Jing Z,5,"From a reliable source, I understand that this branch will be closing soon at the end of this month due to some enhancement adjustment. This was my first gym, and I’m truly grateful to the team for their support throughout my fitness journey here. Located in J Avenue, this gym is both accessible and convenient, with its position in a community mall making it stand out. After workouts, you can easily shop at Villa Market or enjoy healthy meals at Get Fresh and other nearby restaurants.

Although the gym is not particularly large, it offers a calm environment with fewer crowds, which I really appreciated. Its equipment is like the ""Apple products"" of gym facilities, featuring top-tier brands like ""Technogym,"" which greatly enhanced my experience. I noticed some reviews mentioning its size as a drawback, and it almost affected my decision at the beginning. However, I’m happy I gave it a try. Fitness is a deeply personal journey, and for beginners like me, starting at a well-equipped and convenient gym like this can be a great choice. It’s important to rely on multiple sources when deciding on a gym.

The team has also ensured a smooth transition for members during this period, helping us shift our focus to other branches seamlessly. Thank you for creating such a supportive and welcoming fitness space.

Fun fact: ""WE Fitness"" is not a small gym but rather a boutique brand under the same group as Major Cineplex and Blue-O Bowling 🍿🎳  Once you buy a membership, you gain access to not only the gym but also group classes and VIP packages with different tiers and options. Their other branches include Ekkamai, Ratchada, Pinklao, VIE Hotel, and more, allowing members to access different key locations in the city seamlessly."
WE Fitness (J Avenue Thonglor),Elliot Morrow,3,"If you’re in to cardio and basic fitness, this is an okay gym. There is plenty of cardio equipment and a lot classes to keep you in a good exercising habit.

But if you enjoy squats, deadlifts, using an Olympic bar or generally want to work on strength, forget about this place and join the WE Fitness at Ekkamai BTS. That branch is a lot bigger and a lot cheaper."
WE Fitness (J Avenue Thonglor),Krabi International Boxing Stadium,5,"Just went out from a quick session, I arrived a bit late then 9 pm , the manager allowed me to training and don't charge, it was nice , not about money but for humanity of the team . Very clean gym with all essential for body building and any fitness.. high recommended

WE Fitness (J Avenue Thonglor),Staffan Estberg,3,"Great staff and trainers. The branch in Thong Lo is a bit limited in terms of machines / equipment. What annoys me though is WE's app which is a joke and barely works. As a designer I get frustrated with it, can only imagine what other members are experiencing. Want to change or cancel a training session? Good luck with that!"
WE Fitness VIE Hotel วี ฟิตเนส โรงแรมวี,keen Tan,4,"The fitness located inside the hotel.  Free parking without stamp.  Very friendly staffs especially lady at the front.  Even though the gym quite small compare with other branches.  There is only one studio.  Not much class during the day. A plus with the outdoor swimming pool.  Inside the locker room offer steam room, jacuzzi and locker with card.  Free bottle of drinking water and coffee.   Two towels provided.  So far so good overall."

WE Fitness VIE Hotel วี ฟิตเนส โรงแรมวี,Siam C,4,"Good enough, nice pool, and free park, nice accommodations, tasty ABF"
Fitness First Club Iconsiam,Walter White,2,"Not a serious gym—many gimmicks, trying to be like an “Equinox” gym in the USA but lacking the foundation. The side benefits are cool, but they forgot to make the core product good—the gym itself. It’s advertised as 4,000 square meters, but in reality, the weights area is at most 500 square meters.

PROS:

Free flavored water, free coffee, and a nice sitting area.

Pool with a very nice view. (But honestly, most buildings in BKK have a pool, so it’s not that special.)

Nice cardio area.

Dyson hair dryer in the bathrooms (very worn, but still cool).

CONS:

The weights area is a joke. Only 1 Smith machine and only 1 hip abduction machine for thousands of members. Not even a single machine for hip thrusts. This setup is acceptable for a condo/hotel gym, not a 3,500 baht/month gym.

The price is insane. Even with a 24-month subscription, it’s 3,000+ baht/month—almost $100. A one-day pass is 1,070 baht (about $30). Even in the USA, gyms rarely charge that much.

They have only one piece of each essential machine. Some people sit on a machine for 30 minutes, doing 5 reps and then taking a 10-minute phone break in between. You end up waiting and waiting… This might be acceptable at a 1,000-baht gym, but not at this price.

The staff lies about the lack of a free trial (there is one) and tries to lock you into a minimum 5-month contract.

Overcrowded even early in the morning and at noon. You still end up waiting for machines for long periods—even if you come at 1 p.m. on a weekday.

Summary:
This place has the potential to be the best gym in Thailand, but they need to completely rethink the weights area. Just copy the setups at gyms like Elite Gym Pattaya or Sun Fitness Pattaya—places that charge 70% less but still have multiple Smith machines, hip abduction machines, hip thrust machines, and leg press machines."
Fitness First Club Iconsiam,Ni Ranya,5,"The best club among FF in Bangkok.
First impression with a variety of machines on 2nd floor that despite it was my rest day but I ended up workout because all machines are so attractive to try!

Second, pool at the rooftop with Chowpraya view- very nice one with provided bathrobe and space to chill outside. There is also water class.

Lastly, massage spot that helps a lot for relaxation after workout.

If this gym is in your neighbourhood area, worth to apply membership here!"
Fitness First Club Iconsiam,Shota Tokuda,5,"Yeah, I visit here since the Day1. Located on 7th floor. simply take an escalator nearby Momo Paradise from 6th floor. You can witness the state of art of exercising facilities. A number of exercising classes from Yoga,Cross functional training to Bodypump are available here.

However, the quantity of machine is somehow questionable. Is it still sufficient during the rush hour. (after the pre-sale member session - July 2019 onward). The open cardio area isn't huge as much as I expected, even it's obviously larger than Sathorn Square branch.

A number of classes is explicitly not yet available by month and some of construction sites is still ongoing. you can notice some noise in Bathroom even they're try to minimize those sound pollution.

This can offset with and gorgeous salt water temp-controlled swimming pool (25x12m. and 1.25m. depth) with the panoramic view of Bangkok high-rise Skyscepter. They provide workout kits( Jersey and Shorts) Towels and bathrobe without additional charges. Brings swimming suit/outfit, they are not allow those who wearing FitnessFirst's workout kits to swim.

I'd suggest to both Thai and expats here. Some trainers have well spoken English. if you guys are living or working in this neighbourhood. This is the place where you deserve for. (3,000 bath/month, but there has a lucrative discount up to 50% to those AIA Vitality insurer. Thus 1,500 bath/momth is a real bargain.)"
Fitness First Club Iconsiam,Patawee Phadungchiwit (Pat),5,"The high-end gym with amazing view of Chao Praya River.

As you would expect, the gym inside ICONSIAM is one of the most iconic gym I have ever seen. There are plenty of equipments for weight trainnings, cadios, freestyle zone, and even for boxing.

The staffs are trained to ensure the safety and health of the guests. There is also 1-1 trainning session that come up with fee.

The pool is where you can get the most stunning view of the river. I recommend you try some class there as well."
Fitness First Club Iconsiam,Sukhum Cheff Truengtrachitkul,5,"Overall experience here is very good, free fresh coffee here, infused water.

In bathroom lotion from Erb, dyson dryer. But the workout suit here is smaller than other branch.

Swimming pool is available here.

Too crowd on weekday (8.00pm)

I love cycling class here, big screen, high technology and very challenge atmosphere, there’s a gauge comparing to others in the class.

Training machine here is very new and high tech, you will know the rhythm and pacing in each round on the screen showing on the machine.

Locker is overcrowd, same with other branch

In morning time before the mall is opened, very long walk to the entrance from the pier if using boat shuttle."

You are recommended to improve your body and health at this Fitness First Zone, CTW."
Fitness First Zone Central World,Eric Siritiraset,1,"So far the worst experience of being in a fitness club. Some of the club members are extremely rude to others as if manner wasn't taught in his school, so uneducated. And, what's worse is that, when reported, there is no action taken from the staff and the club Manager. Clearly, the staff don't seem to care about their current members at all (see how the experience shifted once they trick you to sign that contract full of ambiguous wordings with them). Instead, they are being greedy and want to hunt for the new ones all the time. Pathetic!"
Fitness First Zone Central World,Eric Strand,5,"I went to this gym/fitness club for several months and it is great! Fitness First has several locations in Bangkok and, of the three I've been to, this is easily the best: it has the most space and the best variety of equipment. It also has not one, but two classic-style Stairmasters, which are the best cardio machines in my opinion. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. They have reasonable rates for day passes and monthly memberships. The club has free flavored water, coffee, and tea, amenities that I have never seen at any other fitness chain. It is located in the excellent Central World mall, so you can go shopping for food after you finish your workout."
Fitness First Zone Central World,noppawan chinachoti,4,The place is quite clean compared to other branches. Trainers are good. Equipment is less than other branches so there's more space than others. Classes are much less than others also.
Fitness First Zone Central World,Gordon Chung,4,"I was visiting Bangkok as a tourist and wanted to have a quick workout session. I got a day pass at this gym near central world, the staff are very helpful so the registration process is done relatively quickly.

It seems that members can also get free towel and clothes which are pretty cool. Perhaps a small suggestion for the gym is that I wish there are more lat pull down machines but other than that, I am quite happy with my experience here!"

Fitness First Central Rama 9,MeMe,3,"At 7floor Central praram 9. Open at 6am-9.30am.
Morning is good coz not a lot of memmer but crowded in the evening,sometimes no available excerise machine."
Fitness First Central Rama 9,Antonio Mele,1,"The gym is quite good but the management isn't.

Lockers often broken. Once when I open the door of a locker the door fell on the floor and luckily it didn't hit my foot.

Shower cabins are being washed during the peak hours with a rubber tube going all around and soaping multiple cabins at the same time, making difficult to find one to use, being spit by water and have to pay attention to don't step on the tube.

Even I have a membership card with barcode on it and they scan it at the entrance I am requested EVERY time to write by myself on their registry name, card number, phone number, time of entrance, company name, others info and sign it.

Even you have a membership to ask for help/suggestions by the many trainers in the gym you have to pay a full membership again.

More trainers than customers.

I saw manager complain with a customer because he was making ""too much noise"" when put down the bar during deadlift exercise. I never saw the guy throwing down the bar but of course some time at the end of the exercise putting down the bar may be no so smoothly because of the weight... Well is this a gym or a library? What do you expect?"
Fitness First Central Rama 9,palakon kotchapansompote,4,"The equipment is well-maintained, and surprisingly, it wasn't crowded at noon on Sunday. They have separate steam and sauna rooms, which is nice. The classrooms are roomy and clean. I wished for more equipment that could connect to Bluetooth devices. Just remember to bring your own towel!"
Fitness First Central Rama 9,Ricky Jamer,4,"Expensive, but decent location. My only major complaint is that the dance/cardio room is right beside the yoga/pilates room, so it can be difficult to focus and relax with the very loud bass and music.

It seems the group exercise classes are mostly in Thai so maybe not the best gym for expats who can't understand Thai."
Fitness First Platinum Landmark Plaza,Dionysius Chia,5,"Visited FF Platinum Landmark on a Saturday. Pretty well equipped and spacious gym that provides attire and towels. The lockers are the more nostalgic version that use keys instead of card tapping to open and close.

Great bodystep workout with Addee, good vibes and energy in the class.

To access the gym, go to the landmark hotel lobby, take the lift to level 4, the lift doors open directly in front of the FF counter."

Fitness First Platinum Landmark Plaza,Vincent k,2,Really death feeling vibe when I doing bench press I have more the feeling I'm lying on a operation table with the lights. But when I'm able to see the ceiling it's looks really dirty. Machines are reasonable clean. But very simplified ordered. My advice would be placing machines against each other from the back so there is more room next more decoration and colours. Last fix the light to bright. Maybe the fitness first club 39 would be a nice example to use.
Fitness First Platinum Landmark Plaza,Tiger Jamie,2,"Can’t speak about the gym but as a guest at the adjacent hotel I use their sauna/steam to relax I presumed their facilities had been updated since 2016 but no, signed in as normal went to collect a towel and a locker token wasn’t given one maybe there used wristband system had to come outside again to get a locker Upon return they couldn’t find my room card was directed to the reception where a card suddenly appears needs a wristband system Fitness First her with the program"

Fitness First - Platinum Q House Lumpini,Stefan Loå,4,"Edited review: I’m adjusting my original 5-star rating to 4 stars due to a significant communication issue. It would greatly improve the experience if at least one staff member had strong English skills.

Six months ago, we agreed that I would maintain a 'passive membership' while I was away from Bangkok. Upon returning, I was told I must now retroactively pay the full 'active membership' rate for all those months — which is roughly 5 to 10 times more expensive.

Despite my attempts to explain the original agreement, the staff didn't understand and insisted on back-charging me the full active rate. No customer can reasonably accept such a charge, and I was left with no choice but to end my membership.

It’s unfortunate, as the facilities themselves are excellent.

...

Original 5 star review (a year ago):
I had so much fun during my first visit, so I stayed for several hours. Very easy and quick service at the desk, and easy lockers and fresh shower area. Very spacious and big areas for cardio, muay thai, stretching, free weights, machines, and all kinds of extra fitness equipment. And they got group classes like zumba and Body Combat every day. Free water, coffee, and tea in the adjoining cafeteria. It is very much space to move around and have fun while keeping in shape. One of the top 10, or even top 5, gyms I have visited all around the world."
Fitness First - Platinum Q House Lumpini,TP TP,3,"Pros:
The gym boasts a commendable array of machines and cardio equipment, well-suited for general fitness enthusiasts. Its 24/7 operating hours offer unparalleled flexibility for various schedules, complemented by the convenience of three hours of complimentary parking. Additionally, the provision of free hot beverages and water reflects a thoughtful approach to member satisfaction.

Cons:
However, this facility is not tailored for individuals pursuing serious strength training or those with more advanced fitness goals. The atmosphere aligns more with a “Planet Fitness” ethos, emphasizing general health and wellness rather than pushing the boundaries of physical performance. For dedicated lifters, the limited availability of only one squat rack and a noticeable absence of focus on lower-body training can be significant drawbacks. Leg day, in particular, appears to be undervalued, while the gym culture skews heavily toward upper-body workouts.

During peak hours (6-7 PM), issues such as machine monopolization and excessive phone use become commonplace, detracting from the overall gym experience. In addition, a number of trainers regularly occupy machines for extended supersets with their clients, further limiting access to equipment. Some trainers also encourage suboptimal practices, including half-reps and ego lifting, which may foster poor training habits. The locker room, frequently cramped and overcrowded, exacerbates the inconvenience. Furthermore, most trainers at the gym don’t appear to have the ability to bench 225 lbs, squat 315 lbs, or deadlift 405 lbs, raising questions about their qualifications to guide others through serious strength training. For serious lifters or those seeking a more focused, efficient training environment, alternative facilities may be more appropriate."
Fitness First - Platinum Q House Lumpini,Andrew Mueller,1,"Gym is super nice. Unfortunately the members don’t know much about gym etiquette and are super rude. If you have a routine add at least 30-40min to your workout waiting for machines. With all the trainers I would have expected more people to know how to use the machines

Update: I had one day in BKK on my way home. The patrons are so uneducated in gym etiquette that I needed up getting one machine in over 30min. If I had more time to look for a different gym I’d go there. I strongly encourage visitors to find a different gym. It’s absolutely not worth the 1000bhat per day"
Fitness First - Platinum Q House Lumpini,James Zhe,5,"Well equipped gym in a central location. A bit pricey if you want day passes (they come in packages of 10 passes), otherwise the monthly membership is very reasonable.

Gym facilities are very well appointed and never too crowded during morning and afternoon hours. Provides fresh workout gear, towels, coffee and tea, and a small lounge area."
Fitness First - Platinum Q House Lumpini,I S,2,"Been going here for several years, in 2021 maintenance declined significantly. As for June 2022 male bathroom is not working. 3 out of 3 urinals are leaking, 1 out of 3 toilets are not usable, bathroom dispensers, scale and trash canes are broken. Machines in general need better maintenance as well, the cables are broken often and bolts and screws are missing. Floor in the yoga studio is not stable, half of the bikes in cycling studio are not usable. I will still come here because of location but if you have a choice better look elsewhere"
Fitness First Platinum Sathorn Square,Salem Al-Hilal,4,"The best thing about this gym is that it’s practically my neighbor — very convenient for me! Prices are also fair compared to back home, so my wallet doesn’t complain. The facility is nice, though some of the equipment looks like it has been working out longer than me. 😅 Still, everything is maintained and usable. I just wish they had a step master — maybe they’re keeping it as a “hidden boss level” for the future!"
Fitness First Platinum Sathorn Square,Stella Ferguson,5,"Excellent facilities. Right at the SkyTrain station...the gym is a few steps away. Free towels to use are handed to you when you enter, there's a steam room in the well equipped change rooms, hairdryers etc. Gym Equipment is in perfect condition and good views from 3rd floor. Fresh coffee and fruit infused cold water with WiFi and seating area. Staff is wonderful and very happy to assist and show you around. It was a fabulous experience.!!! I highly recommend Fitness First and look forward to going again on my next visit to Bangkok. Well done to the staff ✓✓✓"
Fitness First Platinum Sathorn Square,Felipe Gonzalez Noguchi,3,"Pros: free coffee, good locker rooms, between 10-4 and 8-9 the gym is relatively empty

Cons: for a gym this expensive and crowded, not a lot of equipment. The ""personal trainers"" are often loud or bothering, at 5-7pm they blast gym class music like it's a nightclub"
Fitness First Platinum Sathorn Square,PS,4,"Don't like the 2 floors concept (minus one star). The reception, coffee area and bathroom are located downstairs while the excercise area is located upstairs. Prefer the one floor concept like QHouse and Landmark but then this is certainly a matter of personal liking. Five stars for closing at midnight on weekdays. Another plus is that it is conveniently located with direct access from Chong Nonsri Station."

I have a bodycombat class at 4pm today. It was totally a great workout. Great instructor, I’m totally burn out after so many days of good food in Bangkok. Thank you fitness first for making travel workout the process fantastic for members easy process. Keep it going."
Fitness First - Platinum Siam Paragon,Serhii Kryjanovskyi,1,"paid one-time training, the price is exorbitant 1070 baht, to visit for free you need to register on the website and wait for the administration's response. in general I do not recommend. subscription for at least 3 months. look for another gym"
Fitness First - Platinum Siam Paragon,Iambaconn,3,"I visited Fitness First using a free trial and was impressed by the variety of group exercise classes and the overall quality of the facilities.

That said, my first impression was somewhat affected by the experience at the front desk. During my visit on the morning of May 20, 2025, the receptionist—specifically a woman with long straight hair—was noticeably unfriendly and rude. Although she answered my questions, her tone was curt, and she avoided eye contact, making the interaction feel cold and unwelcoming. For potential members trying out the gym for the first time, a warm and helpful reception can make all the difference. I hope the management takes this into consideration to better align the customer service with the high standards of the gym itself."
Fitness First - Platinum Siam Paragon,Gunta Bogdane,1,"Was staying in Bangkok for two days so decided to go for a free trial as per their website advertisement.
Filled in the form, it was asking for Thai mobile number which we did not have (been using eSIM while travelling), and there was no option to change the country code however the application still went through even with skipping this step.
Booked a taxi,  20min drive and were there just after 6am when the gym opens.
Receptionist was very unwelcoming, she did not greet us, whole time she was using the phone for translating.
Showed her the confirmation email to say that free trial has been confirmed, she asked if we had registered to which we said yes, there is the confirmation. She then rang someone (bear in mind all this time we were not told anything), and then she asked us for Thai mobile number which we did not have, obviously as we had eSIM while travelling. She then shows Google translate which states - “contact 1-2 days”.
Basically someone will get in touch.
We then asked how much is one days pass?
1070 Thai Bhatt per person. Daylight robbery!
Anyway - if you offer free trials, be ready for tourists to apply and do not expect them to have Thai SIM card and world is more advanced now and people can get eSIM before the traveling.
Also, why do not you make the whole experience easier and simple. If I want to do a days gym session, I am not going to wait for 2 days until someone gets in touch with me.
Also, if you do not want to interfere with customers and find it difficult to be welcoming etc - don’t work in the public service sector."
Fitness First Platinum Pearl Bangkok,Sukhum Cheff Truengtrachitkul,4,"Very high climbing to the building, 4 floors. Using elevator is recommend.

Next climbing is to go to changing room and toilet, super off from machine workout area.

Other was good."
Fitness First Platinum Pearl Bangkok,Badger,1,"Disappointed: My daughter came to gym. I brought her here and am taking her home afterward. I asked to merely sit in their lobby to wait for my daughter as all coffee shops in the building are closed. The person in charge of staff at reception desk refused. I was told the rule is members only. No exceptions. Also disappointed that there is no one who could make a decision on an exception. (I asked nicely.) Respectfully, maybe think of making allowance for exceptions to the rule for parents waiting?"
Fitness First Platinum Pearl Bangkok,Elijah Whaley,1,"Horrible customer care! The contract is a borderline scam. They will require you to sign a 12 contract that will automatically renew without notice. When you try to cancel, they will tell you that you need to give 30 days warning.

So, you’ll very likely pay a minimum of 2 additional months. If you press them hard, they ask you to cancel your credit card (absolutely ridiculous!!!).

I escalated my appeal to the management team. They refused to reimburse me and never contacted me back, even when promised. I was forced to deal with the situation through my credit card company.

I would not recommend this gym. It’s more expensive than a nice gym in the USA."

Fitness First Central Rama 9,Ollie B,4,"A good gym, on the expensive side for the price but it's inside the mall. Seems like 100's of PTs.... Very busy after 5pm.

Showers need renovating
Steam room is great
Air con not cool enough
NOBODY PUTS WEIGHTS BACK PROPERLY 😅
Staff friendly"
Fitness First Central Rama 9,MeMe,3,"At 7floor Central praram 9. Open at 6am-9.30am.
Morning is good coz not a lot of memmer but crowded in the evening,sometimes no available excerise machine."
Fitness First Central Rama 9,Antonio Mele,1,"The gym is quite good but the management isn't.

Lockers often broken. Once when I open the door of a locker the door fell on the floor and luckily it didn't hit my foot.

Shower cabins are being washed during the peak hours with a rubber tube going all around and soaping multiple cabins at the same time, making difficult to find one to use, being spit by water and have to pay attention to don't step on the tube.

Even I have a membership card with barcode on it and they scan it at the entrance I am requested EVERY time to write by myself on their registry name, card number, phone number, time of entrance, company name, others info and sign it.

Even you have a membership to ask for help/suggestions by the many trainers in the gym you have to pay a full membership again.

More trainers than customers.

I saw manager complain with a customer because he was making ""too much noise"" when put down the bar during deadlift exercise. I never saw the guy throwing down the bar but of course some time at the end of the exercise putting down the bar may be no so smoothly because of the weight... Well is this a gym or a library? What do you expect?"
Fitness First Central Rama 9,palakon kotchapansompote,4,"The equipment is well-maintained, and surprisingly, it wasn't crowded at noon on Sunday. They have separate steam and sauna rooms, which is nice. The classrooms are roomy and clean. I wished for more equipment that could connect to Bluetooth devices. Just remember to bring your own towel!"
Fitness First Central Rama 9,Ricky Jamer,4,"Expensive, but decent location. My only major complaint is that the dance/cardio room is right beside the yoga/pilates room, so it can be difficult to focus and relax with the very loud bass and music.

It seems the group exercise classes are mostly in Thai so maybe not the best gym for expats who can't understand Thai."

Fitness First Central Bangna,Felis Silvestris Catus,1,"One day pass is 972 Baht. Don't know anything about the inside of this gym. But it's worth knowing this considering the average salary for a Bangkokian to be around 25.000. I'm not looking for a bargain by any means, but make this make sense."
Fitness First Central Bangna,TP TP,3,"This facility boasts an impressive array of weight training equipment and cardio machines, catering to a variety of fitness needs. Notably, this branch is equipped with two squat racks, a rarity for commercial gyms, which is a commendable feature for those focusing on strength training. However, the air conditioning in the cardio area has been inoperative for an extended period, and the lack of urgency in addressing this issue is somewhat disappointing. A significant downside, though, is the frequent presence of a large group of boisterous and disruptive elderly patrons during the morning hours, who tend to monopolize the public areas, creating an unpleasant atmosphere for other gym-goers."
Fitness First Central Bangna,József Stempel,4,"Amazing view! Very well equipped. Dark side: too cold to me. Inner height too low, so the cold air flow come directly to your body."
Fitness First Central Bangna,Travyy,5,My favorite gym in Udom Suk. 5-Star staff and clean facility. Has all the necessary equipment to accomplish your fitness goals.

Fitness First Central Chonburi ฟิตเนส เฟิร์สท์ เซ็นทรัลชลบุรี,V K,2,"The club is write small, has just one studio, and the machines stand literally elbow to elbow, but still, it's OK. Sauna and steam are small but really good and hot, and provision of free fruit-scented water, hot green and black tea and coffee is nice.

However, it's truly amazing and has turned as a very unpleasant surprise that the club does not provide... towels! Any towels for that matter - neither small towelettes to wipe the sweat, nor large bath ones to use after the shower or while at sauna or steam room.

What is it, Fitness First?! Virgin Active offers THE WHOLE SET of towels in various sizes and, on demand, even shorts, t-shirts and socks! And you...

As I was not expecting that and visited for the first time, left wet and very, very unhappy."

Fitness First Central Chonburi ฟิตเนส เฟิร์สท์ เซ็นทรัลชลบุรี,Savvy Physique Academy,1,"The trainers at this branch reserve all the machines and equipment for their trainees, ignoring the other members waiting to use them.

Fitness First Central Chonburi ฟิตเนส เฟิร์สท์ เซ็นทรัลชลบุรี,Pawida Balfour (Speak English with Pawi),5,"Everything is good except the steam room. I don't know what it's like for men. But in the women's room, the ceiling has black mold. I notified the fitness center and there was no way to fix or change it. The ceiling should use ceiling material for wet rooms. It won't be moldy."

The location and equipment are up to standard, even though the space is a bit small compared to our Bangkok branch. But I have to say that the trainers and staff here are all lovely. They're all dedicated, enthusiastic, and full of positive energy. They seem happy and professional, unlike anything I've seen at any other branch or gym.

Over the past 30 years, I've been to probably more than 10 gyms. I can tell you, this is the best, especially in terms of classes and staff."

They provide towel (which lack in 2 mentioned branches)

It is not platinum level that basic membership can pass you through.

Soda were discontinue and fruit infused water were replacement. Which is not bad.

Coffee and tea remained."
Fitness First - CentralPlaza Rama 3,Ahmed Al-Betar,5,"Stepping into Fitness First at CentralPlaza Rama 3 is a game changer for anyone serious about their health and fitness. My visit last Wednesday confirmed why this gym stands out in Bangkok. The expansive layout across multiple floors offers not just a vast range of equipment but also dedicated spaces for functional training and group classes, all under one roof.
The vibrant energy is palpable, with fitness enthusiasts engaged in varied workouts, from intense cardio sessions to focused strength training. The trainers are visible and accessible, offering advice and encouragement, contributing to an environment that motivates and supports progress.
The highlight for me was the functional training area with its turf zone. It's a refreshing change from the usual gym setting and perfect for mixing up my routine. Moreover, the cycling studio, with its immersive setup, promises an exhilarating group exercise experience.
Cleanliness and maintenance are clearly top priorities here, with every piece of equipment in top condition. Whether you're a fitness novice or a seasoned athlete, Fitness First at CentralPlaza Rama 3 offers a welcoming and highly conducive space to achieve your fitness goals."
Fitness First - CentralPlaza Rama 3,Aik Sittichai,5,"A spacious three-storeys fitness centre outskirt of downtown Bangkok. The group exercise studio and the mind & body studio are quite large.
All the machines and equipments ate pretty much everywhere but the free weight training zone is relatively small.
The locker room is located on the third floor and if you are a platinum club member, you can access to free towels"
Fitness First - CentralPlaza Rama 3,Lukas Lee,2,"The service needs to improved, it’s my first time to this branch, you need to get the towel card from the front desk to rent the towels, and the staff didn’t mention when I checked in. The facilities needs to be maintained, water is leaking from the ceiling, and the seal of the stairs were ripped off which made me almost fall. :("
Fitness First Central Rattanathibet,Aik Sittichai,4,"A small compact clubs in the FitnessFirst chain, located adjacent to CentralPlaza which offers a good post-gym meal.
The only drawback is that this small club only has one group exercise studio, no yoga studio. Therefore, the numbers of classes are limited and the studio is also small (capable of 20 members only) so it is somewhat packed but overall facilities are great and well maintained"
Fitness First Central Rattanathibet,Nadim Sursock,5,Fitness first for me is the best gym here in Thailand. Not only is there every machine u need at the gym but they have multiple gyms opened throughout town. It's clean and the trainers are quite friendly too all in all I give it two thumbs up.
Fitness First Central Rattanathibet,Abraham Mojihajan,4,I usually travel to Fitness first in various branches to fulfill and balance motivation. At here is also my favorite place. It atmosphere is like tiny Sukumwit under peaceful and large suburbs

Fitness First Central Pinklao,Michael Powacht,2,"15/11/24 It's time for an update. When I thought it's gonna get better, it actually got worse. FF Central Pinklao has changed its location. The new club seems to be smaller than the old one. Maybe a cost-saving measure. Especially the locker room is very cramped in the evening hours. The new club no longer has a sauna, there is only a steam room, which has been out of service for weeks, although it's been finally repaired now.  FF has replaced its equipment, but in my opinion, the equipment at the old location was of better quality. Some of the new equipment makes some strange screeching sounds during lifting. Despite all these shortcomings, it's probably still the best facility in the area I live in, though there is lots of room for improvement. Air-conditioning has vastly improved over the old location. I therefore update my review from a 1-star to a 2-start rating.

I am a member of this club for several years. In the beginning, the gym was clean and facilities were well managed. Good value for money. However, for about a year now, the situation has gotten very bad. The facilities are in a horrible shape. I like to go to the sauna after my workout. But the sauna is now in such a bad condition that it poses a health hazard. The floor is dirty and wet, the wood construction falling apart. Please see pictures below. The shower cabins are in equally bad shape with most soap dispensers broken, see pictures below. I have informed FF Pinklao management about this unacceptable situation, but nothing was done. FF also increased membership fees earlier this year, so the gym should be in good working condition. I can’t speak of other FF branches, so this review only relates to the Pinklao branch. I hope this review helps improving the situation.
Update 2 May 2024: I am sorry to report that the situation has not improved. In fact, it has gotten worse: In most shower cabins, the shower heads are missing, drainage is clogged so one stands in 5cm of water when showering. The locker rooms are in a dismal condition. Many lockers are damaged. The sauna hasn’t been properly fixed since my last review. Management clearly is focused on enrolling more members instead of maintaining the facilities.The only reason I am still a member is because it’s the closest gym in my area."
Fitness First Central Pinklao,Doge play game,1,"Eversince the gym relocated it has become worse. There is less machines like for example no more leg press. In general there is too few machines and i have to wait so long now to get to use one I feel like thought more about looks and less about actual usability of this gym after the relocation

Extremely disappointed!"
Fitness First Central Pinklao,Brandon Alati,3,"They have more trainers than guests, it’s wildly unnecessary. Staff hassled my friend about a guest pass. It’s in the pricer side, more than many gyms in the west. They only have 1 squat rack, it’s clearly not designed for any serious lifters. Best for cardio moms and people who only want to work with a trainer. The favored water they offer for free is the best part though. Wasn’t bad overall."
Fitness First Central Pinklao,Aik Sittichai,5,"A vast and spacious branch for FitnessFirst, the gym is relatively aged which can noticed from outdated locker platforms and some machines are depleting. What good about the club is that the club equipped with 3 big studios, 2 group exercise studios (1 with designated TRX / Yoga Fly studio), and a regular yoga studio."
Fitness First Central Pinklao,Héctor Guzmán,1,"Today in the morning I was very enthusiastic about joining the sport club, I did my online registration in the official website and did the corresponding payment that was later confirmed by my bank and by fitnessfirst (email )
Then I headed to fitness first central pinklao only to be told that I was not allowed to used the gym because of “system issues”. I feel very disappointed because the management was not helpful at all, but on the contrary: misleading, ambiguous and unclear in all their “explanations”
The manager actually offer me to use the fitness center for 1 (yes, one) day, but not allowed to use it later
I urge people who plan to register online be careful with the tricky website that takes money but when you arrive to the gym you cannot use it
So disappointed, at the end they refunded the money (cash) , and did not respect the online deal"
Fitness First Central Chaengwattana,Ronnelle Adams,3,"The gym is normally fine. But I'm writing this because in the last month, I've noticed roaches in the locker room. The numbers are definitely increasing (I saw 5 roaches this morning). The cleaning staff are always busy cleaning, so they are not the problem. I think management should call in a company to spray for pests. Other than that, the gym is fine."
Fitness First Central Chaengwattana,Phawinpon Chotwanvirat,4,"The club is large, clean, and fully equipped with all kinds of weight machines, including 3 independent studios for GX, cycling, and Yoga. However, the lockers still use a mechanic key for opening, and the front officers may not be enthusiastic about providing a key during members' check-ins; you'll need to ask for the locker card. There is no towel service here, and if you ask the officers for it, they might prefer to decline. The member lounge is very comfortable and lively (though it could be noisy)."
Fitness First Central Chaengwattana,Antony Bell,5,"A nice gym to go and work out in. They have started to upgrade the equipment, which is good. However, they really need to upgrade the weight plates. They are old with chunks missing out of them. Coffee is good, always clean plus nice friendly staff"
Fitness First Central Chaengwattana,Prapawin W,1,"Expensive comparing on what you get! Personally believe that this branch is the worst of FF. unprofessional staff and the machines are quite old. If you pay at this price and you can go to somewhere else or other branches of FF, it's much better. Some trainers are also lust to my girlfriend when she comes here alone. Not a nice branch."
Fitness First Central Chaengwattana,Groanz,3,"Rather expensive. Friendly staff, but they turn the lights of 1sec after closing time. You will be searching for your stuff in the changing rooms with a flashlight together with other visitors. So be sure to bring your flashlight!"

Fitness First - Central Hatyai,Richter B,5,"Fitness First is located at Central Hatyai, but it is outside the mall, on the 1st floor. When you first walk in, you will be confused and unable to find it. The fitness center is in good condition, with new equipment and is well-cleaned. The place is spacious and ok. There are large and small towels provided, but no clothes, so you have to bring your own. There is a spacious steam room, a group X room, a bicycle room, and a yoga room. Everything is complete."
Fitness First - Central Hatyai,Master Khing,5,"Fitness First High-class fitness center  There were many different types of exercise classes. There was a steam stream and a bathroom for showering, but the door couldn't be locked, haha. I was shocked and my spine tingled.
There is water, coffee, and tea available to drink as well.
The steel dumbbell balls are very big, weighing up to fifty kilograms each 😅🤣"

Fitness First The Mall Bangkhae ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เดอะมอลล์ บางแค,Samuel Faure,4,"One of the best gym I've ever been to. All the equipment you need, fresh infused waters and coffee.

Fitness First The Mall Bangkhae ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เดอะมอลล์ บางแค,ramiss gulzar,1,Very bad and 3rd class gym. They only have few limited  machines which don't  work properly  and if any machine breaks or stop working  it takes minimum  15 days to fix sometimes  even 20 days. If you go and complain they will not listen. Very  poor service  don't  waste your money go to some  other gym
Fitness First The Mall Bangkhae ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เดอะมอลล์ บางแค,Kophong Assawachaiwasin,1,The worst branch in terms of service and how people communicate. No smiles and not user-friendly.

Fitness First The Mall Korat ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เดอะมอลล์ โคราช,József Stempel,5,Located on the third floor next to cinema. I love that place. Good vibe and lovely staffs. Literally fitness though not for hardcore body building I still use and recommend it.
Fitness First The Mall Korat ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เดอะมอลล์ โคราช,Emlyn T,5,This is the best gym I've used in years. Amazing trainers who are at the top levels and the amount of classes each day is staggering. Tell worth the membership fee
Fitness First The Mall Korat ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เดอะมอลล์ โคราช,Angelina Pelivan,1,So many gyms in the area with better/more equipment for less than a 1/10th of the price for a single day drop-in. Seriously
Fitness First The Mall Korat ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เดอะมอลล์ โคราช,oceanicthai1,5,"This is a beautiful gym with top quality instructors and equipment. It is also expensive. A year’s membership is around 25,000 Baht. You can go online and get a 3 day free pass to check it out."
Fitness First The Mall Korat ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เดอะมอลล์ โคราช,Diana,1,Absolutely ridiculous one day pass (850 thb) for not that much equipment.
Fitness First The Mall Thapra ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เดอะมอลล์ ท่าพระ,Ahmed Al-Betar,5,"Having visited Fitness First at The Mall Thapra just yesterday, the experience is still fresh in my mind. As I entered the gym, I was struck by the spacious and modern interior. The array of equipment was impressive, offering everything from state-of-the-art resistance machines to a vast selection of free weights that cater to both beginners and seasoned gym-goers.
The gym atmosphere was invigorating, filled with a motivating energy that's contagious. What stood out to me was the cleanliness of the space and the orderly arrangement of the equipment, which made navigating through my workout a breeze.
The staff at Fitness First were approachable and knowledgeable, ready to assist with a machine setup or to offer a piece of quick advice on form. The studio for group classes was another highlight, with a lineup of sessions that catered to various fitness levels and preferences.
What I appreciated most was the sense of community I felt. Whether it was a nod of encouragement from a fellow gym enthusiast or a group class that felt like a team effort, the environment was welcoming and supportive.
After my workout, I felt rejuvenated and already excited for my next visit. Fitness First at The Mall Thapra isn’t just a place to exercise; it's a fitness hub where you're encouraged and inspired to meet your health and wellness goals."
Fitness First The Mall Thapra ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เดอะมอลล์ ท่าพระ,Tanya King,1,The covid -19 protection protocal is poor. Some of the staffs wears the mask under the nose. RIDICULOUS
Fitness First The Mall Thapra ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เดอะมอลล์ ท่าพระ,Phil G,1,"Weirdly expensive - I was quoted 800+ baht for a one day pass! 1 Month pass was around 3500, approx £87 for access! This reduces a lot for longer term memberships. The message is pretty clear - no foreigners."
Fitness First The Mall Thapra ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เดอะมอลล์ ท่าพระ,Jack Lee,1,"Some receptionists are incredibly incompetent in handling issues there. My iPhone 7plus was stolen on the 5/09/2018 as I was fetching water within 3 minutes. They didn’t know what to do, no procedures for handling such case. Eventually , they just ignore the case. They only said , they will call me back if the thief returns it back. Who in the hell would return it if they have stolen it & shut the phone already?  They didn’t even consider announcing it publicly. Please improve the security since there is only one camera at the entrance, giving an opportunity for the theif. I have heard of many such cases happened in Fitness first the mall Thapra at the police station I reported at."
Fitness First The Mall Thapra ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เดอะมอลล์ ท่าพระ,Daniel Middick,5,Awesome place to workout. The trainers are well educated and will be patient with you to explain any aspect of the training process. They have classes nearly all the time and almost everybody can speak English. They are very helpful and accommodating.
Fitness First The Mall Bangkapi,Essa Wajdi,1,"Hello
I am one of your club customers, and I am writing to express my frustration with the complications I encountered while trying to postpone my membership for two months. I found the procedures required to postpone my membership extremely complex and time-consuming, causing significant frustration and disrupting my plans.

Furthermore, I noticed that the club lacks a staff member who speaks fluent English to facilitate communication with non-Arabic speaking customers. This made dealing with management extremely stressful, as I struggled to understand the procedures and obtain the necessary support.

I request that you seriously consider these issues and take immediate steps to simplify the membership postponement process, as well as provide staff who are fluent in English to improve the customer experience. I look forward to your prompt response with clarification on how to resolve this issue and ensure smooth operations in the future."
Fitness First The Mall Bangkapi,Narumon Wessayasirin,5,"Nice gym,  many class to join like yoga,  cycling, dancing and weight lifting.
Machine look OK not new but not too old.
They have big area for functional groups training every 30min during peek time (should confirm with class time table again) all of the thing are free expect personal trainer need to pay extra (~1000฿/hr depends on level of the trainer.
They have locker room and streaming inside close to bathroom.  Note this brunch don't have towel to service you should bring your own that all...  Enjoy your gym time 💪"
Fitness First The Mall Bangkapi,J Y K,5,One of the best Fitness First locations. All areas are spacious vs. other locations and Class Instructors & Trainers are very helpful & professional.
Fitness First The Mall Bangkapi,Steve Hannan,3,"Definitely a good gym, plenty of free weight, cables and machine. Change rooms were very clean and well presented and also includes a traditional sauna. Locker hire is included, I paid for a casual pass which was quite expensive compared to Australian gyms. Plenty of space and didn’t have to wait for anything."
Fitness First The Mall Bangkapi,Jaroslav Bobosik,5,"Well equipped, extraordinary gym, big spaces, everything you need and a little extra. You can enjoy yourself after or before a workout in a resting area with hot or cold refreshments with no extra charge! Every gym should have that."
Fitness First The Mall Ngamwongwan ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เดอะมอลล์ งามวงศ์วาน,Dionysius Chia,5,"Navigation: from the main entrance on the ground floor, with the information counter on your right hand side, walk straight in till you reach the lift lobby near the back of the mall (on your right side). There’s a set of lifts that serve the higher floors- take the lift to level 15 to reach the front counters of Fitness First.

Came in using Fitness first passport. As it’s not a platinum branch, no attire and towels are provided.

Decent equipment for working out, also enjoyed the Bodystep class by Toy - Good energy, great vibes 🙌"
Fitness First The Mall Ngamwongwan ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เดอะมอลล์ งามวงศ์วาน,Candice,1,"worst services ever. how can they hire bad attitude and rude staffs. bathroom dirty and smelly. I never had a bad experience in other branch in Bangkok.

I was look up on news. There was someone able to steal stuff in locker room back then."
Fitness First The Mall Ngamwongwan ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เดอะมอลล์ งามวงศ์วาน,Aik Sittichai,4,"A little run down fitness centre (of course it has been opened for like 15 years) but most of the equipment are in good condition.
The newly refurnished playground and freestyle zone are spacious and safe.
The locker rooms were vast and clean except the shower rooms are little run down, for example, hot shower wont work properly (some day you can only get ambient water)"
Fitness First The Mall Ngamwongwan ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เดอะมอลล์ งามวงศ์วาน,Nathalie Ona,3,"- aggressive on sales
- very traditional gym
- wide range of machines but one squat rack?
- crowd is not the best, seems clique-ish, stays in one machine for 30 minutes, not the type that’s locked in and know what they’re doing
- hard to find, but for some reason still busy
- has steam room and sauna but very tiny"
Fitness First The Mall Ngamwongwan ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เดอะมอลล์ งามวงศ์วาน,Big Ox Little Bird,2,856 THB for a day pass. That is outrageous. It is definitely not worth it unless you live here. There is Best Gym not too far away that is much bigger and only 60 thb for a day pass. Also If you can even find this place (took us 15 minutes). You need to go to the end of the mall away from the main road and take the special elevators to the 15th floor.
Fitness First Home Pro Petchkasem ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท โฮมโปร เพชรเกษม,Thaneerat Khonchan,4,I love this club as the area of car parking is plenty and convenient for whoever come to excercise or shopping at Big C or Home pro.

Fitness First Terminal 21,Mark,5,"I go to several Fitness Frist locations. They can be more spacious, but though compact, this has almost all of the same equipment and facilities (locker, sauna, etc). But this one does not have a sauna, just a steam room, but thats the only really noticable gap for me. It is on the 6th floor and the gym is on a mezzanine above, so its a few escalators or an elevator to get there. In the mornings, its is very quiet (6-8) which is really nice. Its mostly Thai, not too many westerners if any. Fitness First seems to have a pretty repeatable formula - always the same: clean, same equipment, same amenities,  same furnishings, same finishes and style. Everything. Aside from the space, which depends on the location, the rest is verbatim. So if you like FF, then you will like them all. If you don't you wont like any. Though its a bit more expensive and carries a commitment (5 or 12mo) which I don't like, but I deal with that, because the gym is the best around - a great variety of equipment, trainers (if you opt for that), clean, and orderly. I like the trainers, can get some good guidance if you put in the work, and they have muay thai (just for fitness)

They could use to lose a little of the ""big corporate"" gym feel in terms of management and staffing, but if thats what it takes for a repeatable formula, so be it. Right across the street is Jetts. Much cheaper, but the equipment, ameneties, and lockers (eww) are really lacking. Anytime fitness is opening soon, so that might be an option, I will try it when it opens as it coincides with my renewal timing for FF.

There are a few other gyms around, but they don't compare at all, some are a little less money, but most are more, and universally they all don't have all the equip and amenities.

Hope this helps."

Fitness First Seacon Square,1 sharkchili,1,"I’ve been looking for a new gym in Bangkok recently, so I came here to check out the equipment and facilities. When I got to the front desk, I asked the receptionist if they offer a free trial because I wanted to see what they have. But the woman at the front desk responded with a really bad attitude and told me they don’t offer any free trials. 😂 All I can say is that the service here is nowhere near the level of Virgin Active."
Fitness First Seacon Square,Kamman Janpiam,4,"Good place in terms of Gyms. It's inside a mall but you can access it before the mall opens, by parking the car on floor 2b and entering the mall on floor 4, which is the floor of the gym. The facility is clean. Compared to the other FF gym in this area this one in on one floor."
Fitness First Seacon Square,Todd Beuckens,5,"Excellent gym. It is the best branch that I have seen. I love working out there. Big and spacious with lots of equipment and odd stuff for imaginative workout routines. Great lounge with free coffee, tea and infused water."
Fitness First Seacon Square,Judy Zhou,4,The equipment are quite out-of-date and the lightning are a bit dim. But has a wide range of equipment and a lot of class choices. Not the best branch yet also not the worst.
Fitness First Seacon Square,Peerasit Vutipongkul,5,"A/C very cold!!! If you come here anytime before 10:00, brace yourself.
Lots of cardio machine compare to the size of this branch.

Fitness First Megabangna ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เมกาบางนา,Artyom Kolpakov,1,This place is overcrowded. People are using training equipment and machines for a long time sitting and playing their phones. Are you ready to waste your time waiting for others? Sauna is never hot enough. They are pretending to be nice before you buying a subscription and trainer service but after they don’t care about you and you. The managers are useless. Categorically don’t suggest to come here.
Fitness First Megabangna ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เมกาบางนา,TP TP,3,"This commercial gym, conveniently located within a shopping mall, offers a sufficient selection of free weights and cardio equipment to accommodate individuals pursuing general fitness objectives. However, due to the high density of residential properties in the vicinity, peak hours—particularly in the evening—result in excessive overcrowding, significantly diminishing the training experience.

For serious lifters, the facility is likely to prove inadequate. The gym provides only a single squat rack, an oversight that severely limits strength training efficiency. Additionally, the absence of a plate-loaded leg press machine further restricts lower-body development options. The barbells available are not standard Olympic models, deviating from the conventional 20kg (45lbs) specification, which may pose an inconvenience to those accustomed to competition-grade equipment.

The overall atmosphere lacks the intensity found in more strength-focused environments, as the majority of patrons prioritize general fitness over hypertrophy or powerlifting objectives. A notable observation is the prevalence of underdeveloped lower bodies among male gym-goers, indicative of an apparent neglect of leg training—an unfortunate yet all-too-common phenomenon.

Furthermore, the excessive presence of so-called “trainers” clad in red polo shirts monopolizing machines and training areas exacerbates the issue. Many of these individuals appear ill-equipped to provide effective strength training guidance, as evidenced by their own inability to perform fundamental lifts at a respectable level—such as a 315lb squat or a 225lb bench press. Consequently, for those dedicated to serious strength progression, this gym falls markedly short of expectations."
Fitness First Megabangna ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เมกาบางนา,Steven,1,"Worst gym I've ever visited. Rudest workers and over priced. 1000thb for a single visit and they will argue everything with you.

Fitness First Megabangna ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เมกาบางนา,Cholthisha Nokkrut,3,"The place is great, for me it is not very old, still ok and up to date. However, the staff there never explains anything to me. I have purchased coach package without knowing what level my coach is. I bought the trail for 8 hours and they assigned coach randomly to me. I paid a pretty high amount of package while my ability is not yet there. I didn't set my goal to be very perfect, I just wanted to start over again since I have been gone for years. I could have chosen the lower level as it would be a good kick-off for me. Plus, no condition or promotion has been introduced to me. There's always an excuse that they didn't know or they thought someone told me already. Staff at the front desk I have no ideas what responsibility they are taking care of. Only scan the member card daily? I had a hard time to find out all of conditions of this place. Those money I spent should have been more valuable and reasonable. I will definitely cancel my membership."
Fitness First Megabangna ฟิตเนส เฟิรส์ท เมกาบางนา,Charles Roger,1,"This is one of the worst gym I ever been.

This is a tourist trap. Very insistent sales with no real value and lack of answers, except to get your money, they will answer instantly.
The sales staff has no respect and will come to you and interrupt your session for no reason, this is a real issue.

You will come up one day and they will tell you that your monthly subscription price increased with no explanation. Trying to contact management is really hard.

There are really better options in the area, more friendly and willing to consider you as a human and not only a wallet to pay them.

On the other hand Coaches are quite nice even if you do not pay for personal training or classes but the main issue comes from sales and management team which makes the overall not welcoming and stressful.

Honestly like other comments before I do not recommend
It’s a trap and this behavior ruins the experience. There is a very negative energy

Moreover:
-Some important infos are only communicated in Thai, so be careful if you don’t speak or read.

-There are cockroaches in the mens bathroom,
But overall the team is constantly cleaning.

-If you come during peak hours, good luck to find a spot to workout or train… this is way overcrowded.

-Slow to repair machines when broken

Seems that they not care about their clients and I am not the only one in that case."

Fitness First The Crystal Ramindra ฟิตเนส เฟิร์สท์ เดอะคริสตัล รามอินทรา,Molly K,3,"This gym is amazing. Very clean, great classes, great equipment, great amenities in a mall with plenty of free parking. The reason this place does not get 5 stars from me is because of the unfair pricing policies. When I signed up, I payed money into some program and  was told that if I worked with a trainer 3 times and came to the gym 8 times, I'd get a refund of money I put it. It's a program to help encourage people to come regularly. Great idea, I thought. When I met all of the requirements, I figured I would get my money back. Instead they said no, you can use the money to buy things from our display, sign up for additional sessions with the trainer or put the money towards a month's payment. But if you did that, your contract will extend by a month. These requirements were not clear at all and it was a case of deceptive marketing."
Fitness First Future Park Rangsit ฟิตเนส เฟิร์สท์ ฟิวเจอร์พาร์ครังสิต,Simona Meesaiyati,2,"I went in for a trial and was very disappointed for several reasons:
1.	The staff didn’t provide any useful information about the gym facilities and repeatedly referred to me as “หนู,” which felt unprofessional and condescending.
2.	Many of the equipment areas, especially the dumbbell section, are poorly maintained. The dumbbells are old, and the floor in front of them is uneven and potentially hazardous.
3.	Most concerning of all, one of only two fire exits on the entire floor is blocked by a deadlift station — an extremely unsafe and unacceptable setup.

I would not recommend this gym."

The 2 stars is for the trainer that told me to “be quiet” as I was doing heavy rows on an OLYMPIC platform, after having been a member for over a year. He then got aggressive with me when I explained this to him. It’s a GYM, sounds of weights should be EXPECTED. Absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable treatment of your customers."
Virgin Active Empire Tower,Brianna Bjorg,5,"This Virgin gym is great! The staff is professional, the gym is what you can expect from a Virgin gym. 3 main floors. With a lap pool, steam room , sauna , salt room also. Absolutely worth a couple of hours. Day / Casual pass is 750baht."
Virgin Active Empire Tower,Sukhum Cheff Truengtrachitkul,3,"The gym is massive, spanning three floors with facilities like a pool and Pilates studio. The overall vibe is luxurious with grey tones, but it feels a bit gloomy, like it’s always about to rain. I attended a Grid class, and while the program and instructor were great at motivating members to hit their calorie goals, the music was a letdown. Despite being ‘licensed,’ it felt like generic free music from SoundCloud newbies—bland, uncreative, and forgettable. No catchy lyrics, no energy, just a dull mix that doesn’t match the premium feel of the gym. Why not invest in real music from Warner or Sony? It’s a shame because it undermines an otherwise solid class. Other areas of the gym also feel outdated, like watching Fashion TV from the early 2000s. Not sure I’ll be back for classes until they improve the atmosphere."
Virgin Active Empire Tower,Lin George,2,On virgin active thailand website、you can see a so touching branding promotion for a 7day free trail for member‘s friends.

Virgin Active Siam Discovery,Sukhum Cheff Truengtrachitkul,3,"Missing some key equipment like the SkiErg and seated cable row. The best part is the super spacious resting area and the convenience of having the changing rooms on the same floor as the gym.

Virgin Active Wireless Road เวอร์จิ้น แอ็คทีฟ ถนนวิทยุ,Helen Li,3,"Dear Virgin Active Management Team,

I am a long-term member of your club, with membership number For many years, I have enjoyed the high-quality services provided by Virgin Active. However, I recently encountered an issue during my membership renewal process, which has left me deeply disappointed.

During the renewal process, I had expected to receive some form of discount or preferential treatment as a loyal member. Unfortunately, the staff not only failed to offer any discounts but also proposed a higher membership fee than what I had previously paid. This has left me both confused and dissatisfied. As a long-standing supporter of Virgin Active, I believe I deserve more respect and consideration.

What further concerns me is the suspicion that the staff may have intentionally withheld the discounts I was entitled to in order to earn higher commissions. Such behavior not only harms my interests but also tarnishes the reputation of Virgin Active. I trust that your club is committed to providing the best service to its members, and I hope this matter can be addressed promptly and fairly.

I kindly request that you review my renewal case and provide a reasonable explanation and resolution. I look forward to your response and hope to continue a positive relationship with Virgin Active."

Virgin Active EmQuartier,Sukhum Cheff Truengtrachitkul,5,"One of the most luxurious gyms in town, conveniently located near Bangkok’s CBD. The classes are excellent, led by professional instructors who elevate the experience with great music. However, the ventilation is lacking—I could smell unpleasant odors during the RPM class, which is not ideal when your heart rate is hitting 160 and holding your breath isn’t an option. Overall, it’s a great gym, but it would be much better with natural light or a more effective fresh air system in the studio rooms."

Virgin Active EmQuartier,d abe,1,"If you like watching people sit on gym equipment and use their phone between sets, this is the place for you.  Need a gym selfie, or videos of you lifting, you certainly wont be alone.  While there are many there working out, there seem to be just as many who like the idea of working out, or appear upset their sets interrupt conversations with personal trainers. Personal trainers are a bit challenging to arrange times with.  Easier to make a doctor's appointment.  In general, staff is aloof.

The gym can get crowded, a great location, and clean environment help--and you can carve out space for your own workouts especially if you run. But not great value compared to other clubs including other Virgin centers.  I would give this a pass."
Virgin Active EmQuartier,Ster nio,2,"if you have signed up for the 50% off promotion on first 6 billings be aware of your payments.

in my case 3 out of first 5 billings they were charging the full price.

i had to go everytime to the counter to resolve the issue only for it to happen again at next billing, very annoying. I went to the gym 4-5 times per week and they told me that you only get the promotion after checking in 2 times every week but they had problems last month with the check-in. (btw. this wasn‘t even mentioned to me nor my friend who signed up on a different day)

so even if you go there a lot and are eligble for the promotion (like in my case) they are not charging the right amounts, the managment told me the IT department said i wasnt the only member with this issue, so every member should be aware.

Even with all this trouble and time i had to waste at the counter there is no compensation for it, they just told me they will cancel the next payment so i get the money back i paid too much so far.

its a shame because i like the gym and the facilities a lot"
Virgin Active EastVille,Emre Senbabaoglu,5,"A 4-storey gym with very high quality weight training machines, treadmills, elyptical bicycles and other electronic gym equipments.

I like cardio machines such as the treadmills and elyptical bicycles with TV screens because they are sturdy.

You can join classes like cycling, pilates, yoga, body pump and body jam. I joined yoga and cycling classes for a couple times and the instructors are professional.

The best thing about this gym is that you do not have to carry a towel with you. The gym provides you sweat and bath towels as well as shampoo, body gel, hair conditioner and body lotion, which are very expensive and quality products.

I recommend you to use the spa pool and you don't need to book for it in advance but you need to book online for the swimming pool from the Virgin application. Although the length of the swimming pool is around 20 meters it is enough for exercise.

The only thing I don't like in the gym is that you have to take a lift to change your floor and wait for it long sometimes.

In overall, it is a very good gym with a friendly staff. The membership fee is a bit more expensive than other gyms but it is worth paying it."
Virgin Active EastVille,Yu Veeravong,5,"Good equipments and facilities and even amenities. Staffs are friendly and helpful. Lots of cute members. Exercise classes are boring, tho. Wish there were more varieties in both class formats and instructors.

Virgin Active Westgate,Sathit V,1,"7-Apr-2025
The standard this branch is sub-par to other Virgin's branches in town (e.g. no gym uniform, RFID lockers, etc.).

Beside, the counter staff are low service-minded and are not well-trained for various available credit card benefits. They simply reject entry with their own condition rather than the bank's whilst customers have their right and privilege to enter. What a shame!

24-Apr-2025
This comment follows the Virgin Active Team's feedback three days ago.

Apart from professionally-sounded and nicely-crafted message in response to my 7-Apr comment, this is the best they probably could do as I cannot see how sincere they have so far been in taking this into consideration or resolving the disgruntled customer's dissatisfaction and lost benefit.

I have actually elevated the matter to the Westgate branch Operations Manager and expressed seriously about what happened. She seemed to 'acknowledge' the disappointment occurred and gave a word to look into the matter and would return a call.

If the foregoing signals some relief and ensures that some actions would be undertaken, guess what came in three days later - a sound of silence!

Perhaps, it is a culture issue specific to this particular branch which we just unfortunately ran into as we have not seen this in other branches.

So far, not even a single word of apology from the staff who caused the issues on the day to us and what they would do for the customers who unnecessarily lost their time and right to enter the club that day. A feedback review here in their mind might just sound too lightly than a social media!"
Virgin Active Westgate,Taksinakorn NONTASINGH,5,"The gym is absolutely fantastic! It’s impeccably clean, which makes working out so much more enjoyable and hygienic. There’s a wide variety of equipment available, ensuring that every workout need is met, whether it’s strength training, cardio, or functional fitness. The staff are incredibly friendly and always willing to help, creating a welcoming and supportive environment. It’s clear that a lot of effort goes into maintaining the space and fostering a great atmosphere for everyone. Highly recommended!"
Virgin Active Westgate,NS K,2,"Not good comparing with other branch that is on same price package, trainer is late to open class, limited facility provided. I would prefer east ville branch anytime. And with free parking policy, it is very hard to find parking spot."
Virgin Active Westgate,Tantorn Waigasee,3,"Virgin Active at Central Westgate has its ups and downs. The location is perfect for Nonthaburi residents, and the facility is pristinely clean. The receptionists are professional, and the personal trainers are polite, which adds to the welcoming atmosphere.

However, the gym equipment feels outdated compared to other Virgin Active locations. Additionally, they don't provide gym clothing, towels, or locker locks, which is inconvenient—especially if you're used to these perks at other branches. On the bright side, the gym is usually empty, so there's no waiting for machines. Overall, it’s an okay option if convenience and crowd-free workouts are your priorities."
Virgin Active True Digital Park เวอร์จิ้น แอ็คทีฟ ทรูดิจิตอลพาร์ค,Rabbitdigital TH,5,"I personally prefer the Jacuzzi at Virgin Active True Digital Park over the one at EmQuartier. It's more spacious and located on a rooftop, which offers a beautiful view especially at night. Perfect for relaxing after a workout."
Virgin Active True Digital Park เวอร์จิ้น แอ็คทีฟ ทรูดิจิตอลพาร์ค,Sukhum Cheff Truengtrachitkul,5,"A great gym, fully equipped with Technogym gear, mixed with some Chinese equipment, but still acceptable. The ventilation here is better than any other branch of this brand. The Grid Training and BodyPump classes on weekends are superb, with excellent instructors and much better music selection. While the interior fittings are less luxurious than the in-town branches, it doesn’t take away from the energetic, ambitious vibe. Highly recommended!

PS: In the 101 True Digital Park compound, this gym is the highlight—everything else, like the food, vibe, and location, feels lacking. Traveling here from downtown is worth it if you’re ready to spend the whole day focusing on fitness, like a suburban training trip with friends. Perfect for that! 😘"
Virgin Active True Digital Park เวอร์จิ้น แอ็คทีฟ ทรูดิจิตอลพาร์ค,Marvin T,3,"Sure! Here’s a cleaner, more concise version of your review:

⸻

Not ideal for weight training, but great for classes and swimming.

Visited around 4 PM on a weekday — staff was very friendly and booking a free trial was easy (aside from the old-school sales pitch). The entrance and pool area feel premium.

However, the gym floor is limited: most machines are constantly in use, and free weights are minimal, making it hard to get a proper workout. Surprising, given the space available.

That said, the group class selection looks solid with plenty of options."
Virgin Active True Digital Park เวอร์จิ้น แอ็คทีฟ ทรูดิจิตอลพาร์ค,Steve McLaughlin,5,"Having lived in Asia since 2009, across Singapore and Bangkok, I can honestly say True Digital Virgin Active is the best offering of the VA gyms between both countries.

Pros:

- Equipment, plenty of the necessary. (Compared to other outlets, this I think has the most squat racks, around 8 I think!)

- Outdoor Pool, always awesome (yes - when it does not rain!)

- Cardio equipment, compared to Emquartier, all modern and new. Emq Virgin has dinosaur era rowers and no ski-ergs at all. This VA has them all.

- If you're looking for a gym with all equipment area for Hyrox, sledge, wall balls, running track, it's all here. No other VA in Thailand can come close to that, so much so, my trainer Gabe Heck specifically sends me to this VA for Hyrox focused work outs.

Now, there are other great gyms focused on Hyrox, like Encore, IronHive and Base - so give them a check, but they are more private and member class focused.

I have read a few reviews about the staff quality, personally, the front desk has always been awesome with me. Whether that's helping me stamp my parking ticket, to updating my membership when I am in Singapore for work (you get 90 days in SG as part of your TH Membership - as in, you can enter the SG gyms on 90 occasions in a year - so good!).

Awesome spot in BKK!"
Virgin Active True Digital Park เวอร์จิ้น แอ็คทีฟ ทรูดิจิตอลพาร์ค,Fabian Schlöndorff,1,"This is wild! I came to an appointment to sign up for the gym in the morning, it was very nice, a lot of machines, almost empty, I thought it was a dream place to workout… well, keep reading…

I asked the person “is always calm like today?” and she said “yes, gym is good and machine good”, marvelous! I started my free training day playing around, almost all machines for myself, just a few people playing around… but wait keep reading…

In about 30 minutes, in the blink of an eye it’s suddenly FULL! It’s full to the point there aren’t machines free anymore and even the areas where there aren’t machines are busy with people doing exercise in the floor, I was literally freaking out, but wait, I told you there is more…

When I was leaving there were like 4 agents signing people in, like filling in more people to the crowded place I explained earlier. I was thinking to myself “if this was so busy today, how will it be when all these new people join the gym?”.

I have been to many gyms, none were crowded as this was. I am not telling you not to sign up, I am just letting you know to be careful and come to check out the gym at around 1pm to 3pm to see with your own eyes."
Fitness24Seven,Earl Lancast,1,"There is a sign at the desk saying no staff from 5-6.  It is now 6:13 and still no staff.  I guess no one works here.  Totally garbage if you are traveling and want to train.  Pick any of the other gyms near here. They can actually staff their counter.  I would love to meet the employee that can’t make it work after their break, but they may never show up.  June 27th 6:15pm. Thanks for ruining my chance to train, I hope you get fired."
Fitness24Seven,Mir Irfan Mehdi Abbas,5,"I stayed in Bangkok for 21 days and all my workout worries were sorted because i came across Fitness24seven. This gym is very hygienic, spacious and great machines. The Staff was well mannered and respectful and always there to help you. Just one suggestion (please add some weight lifting belts).
Thank you Fitness24Seven"
Fitness24Seven,Alexander Romanov,5,"Fully equipped modern gym with 3 floors of different areas. They have AC always working, lockers, showers, a lot of toilets, water refill stations. There’s lots of tourists, and multiple branches across Bangkok. I enjoy working out here."
Fitness24Seven,Rohit Tripathi,5,"Very good gym. Clean spacious and has all the necessary equipment.

Some ill-mannered people work out here in jeans and beach flip flops, and the gym staff doesn't stop them. This affects the atmosphere of the place, and I hope they fix it."
Fitness24Seven,Vicky Feriansyah,5,"The gym equipment is pretty complete, there are 3 floors. Location right in front of the road. It's quite clean but there are some equipment that is poorly maintained"
Fitness24Seven,Kathy Conner,4,"Decent gym located on Rama 9 Road, close to the MRT station and Central Rama 9. The gym is clean and has a good variety of equipment for both cardio and strength training. The air-conditioning works well, which makes workouts comfortable even on hot days. Staff were friendly and helpful during my visit. Not too crowded when I went, and it’s a convenient spot if you live or work nearby. Will definitely come again"
Fitness24Seven,A8 88,4,"Good, clean, air-conditioned, well set up with Nautilus, some people may like or may not. 2 storey. Might join for 3 months and try out."
Fitness24Seven,Vicky Feriansyah,5,"Great place, clean and there are 2 floors. The Locker room for men is quite narrow. But overall okay. The gym equipment is quite complete"
Fitness24Seven,Matúš Veselka,5,"Nice gym, 1 week trial for free, after that monthly membership for 1290 thb, cancelable anytime. First gym in south east asia where i was not sweating like crazy AC on 24 C + Fans, dumbells up to 40 kg, smith, bench, cable machines, gym good also for advanced bodybuilders. Really recommended"
Fitness24Seven,DoubleB,5,"You can attend on any classes you want. Good gym, recommended. Only 1399 baht a month. (Starting fee 999 baht) there's a woman only section offered."
Fitness24Seven,Sammy Sai,3,Fix the smell of the toilet asap and you should provide more benches when it’s crowded it feels like I have nowhere to wait properly. Small gym.
Fitness24Seven,Bom Dia,5,"Review from a member who moved from Phahonyothin: Overall, it's better than Phahonyothin in every way.
- Easy to get to, super convenient for people who love B-clubs.
- Spacious and not crowded.
- New equipment has been added: a squat squat, lat pullover machine, skis, and a squat rack.
- Mat Pilates classes are available.
- The bathrooms are lockable, so no worries! LOL.
- The machines seem to be newer models, with a slight resistance, making them easier to work out.
- The women's gym is awesome, with a great view and privacy.

Things to improve:
- The bathrooms smell bad, but they've gotten a lot better over the past week.
- There's still a lack of stretching equipment, so I probably haven't gotten there yet.
- There's no water filter or fountain! Why?!

I paid 599 baht (presale) and thought it was really good for the price."
Fitness24Seven,ถูก และ ดี (ของดีย่านสะพานไหม่),5,"This gym is of high standard, with new and varied equipment. They have both weight training and cardio areas. It's very clean, and the staff are friendly and helpful. Highly recommended for anyone serious about their health."
Fitness24Seven,Phawat Luangtangvarodom,2,"- Lockers require you to bring your own key! This isn't stated in advance on the website, page, or registration documents (which is similar to other branches where you use your membership card to open and close lockers, so customers should expect the same). There are no keys to lend, rent, or sell.

- Ying Charoen Square doesn't have its own parking lot! You have to compete for parking with Ying Charoen Market. Even worse, the market has four parking lots, but the fitness center can only stamp parking tickets in one place: Parking Lot 2 (but market visitors can park in any lot). And, as always, this isn't stated in advance on the website, page, or registration documents. Customers are left to their own devices. If you have to drive, think carefully. If you can't find a parking spot in Parking Lot 2, you'll have to pay for parking yourself.

- The gym and bathrooms are a bit smaller than expected, but they're fully equipped. They just opened in August and are clean. The equipment is high-quality. The bathrooms are clean and in good condition, but there are only three shower rooms. Maintenance will have to be assessed in a couple of years."
Fitness24Seven,Fung tana,2,"I'd like to deduct points for the restroom. It smells as pungent as a temple toilet, and it's bitter to the throat. I understand the ventilation system may not be good. We should urgently adjust our measures. Clean more often, use deodorizer, and increase the number of cleanings. A gym this new shouldn't be this pungent. We need to make improvements ASAP."
Home Fitness Club Saphan Mai,Sis' NANG,5,"The staff speaks very well, takes good care of you, you can always ask questions. The promotion is good, especially the rides are very good, the standard, the air conditioner is pretty cold, there are many things, including yoga, dance, boxing Come here, don't be afraid to queue because there are so many machines to play as you want. You have to try it first for 7 days. There is a trainer to teach, but it will be a course as agreed. Great restroom that always cleans There is a hair dryer, makeup a stream room that you can relax after gym and near by bts sky train."
Home Fitness Club Saphan Mai,Nonthanat Santithamarux,5,"Lots of machines, many classes to participate in, might be a little crowded in the popular hour but not too crowded. The staff is helpful and nice. The price is also affordable. The restroom is clean. A towel is also offered with no additional cost."
Home Fitness Club Saphan Mai,Lalipat Gitgeatpong,5,"I’ve really enjoyed being a member at this gym. There’s a wide variety of equipment available, which makes my workouts effective and fun. The staff are always friendly and welcoming, and the trainers are very knowledgeable. Many of them have degrees in sports science, so they can give professional advice and create personalized workout programs that suit my goals.

Another big plus is the location—it’s super convenient, right next to the BTS station, which makes it easy to drop by anytime. Highly recommended!"
Home Fitness Club Saphan Mai,Monthira Boonthip,5,"It really feels like home here. The staff is always ready to help and friendly. Moreover, the facilitation is enough for training for different purposes. I will definitely keep coming here. Highly recommended!"
Home Fitness Club Saphan Mai,Kallaya Yimniam,5,"This fitness is really good, comfortable to travel by BTS and get off at Sai Yud station. All staff are friendly,good trainers and a lot of equipment for workout. I’m sure most people like this fitness. Welcome to Home Fitness Club Saphan Mai.💕"
Fitness24Seven,Maddy,5,"I recently joined Fitness 24/7, and the experience has been fantastic right from the start. A big shoutout to Fluke, one of the staff members who made the entire process smooth and welcoming. He was extremely helpful, explained everything clearly, and answered all my questions with patience.

His communication skills are excellent, and his English is good, which made it so much easier for me to understand all the membership details and gym policies. Fluke really went above and beyond to ensure I felt comfortable and informed. You can tell he genuinely cares about the members and enjoys what he does.

If you’re considering joining this gym, I highly recommend it,and if you’re lucky enough to be assisted by Fluke, you’re in great hands!"
Fitness24Seven,Touch Style,5,"1,300 THB per month for a 24-hour gym is an amazing deal. They have top-of-the-line Nautilus machines and more equipment than you’ll ever need. Absolutely love it!"
Fitness24Seven,Alex Flips,1,"Lots of broken equipment.

Vending machine is always empty.

Too many staff in the gym.

The staff got in my way a few times. Is it necessary to have 4 staff trainers on the floor at one time?

Too many people also."
Fitness24Seven,Daton Chris,4,"Comparing to the price point and location, Fitness 24-7 is really giving its members to the best.

This branch, Paholyothin road or just 50 meters from 5 Yeak Lad Praw BTS Train station. Or taking public buses to this branch and there is no need to walk inside the sub street as the gym is on the main road. You cannot really miss it.

The group classes are also inclusive in the membership, Play as you can…!!"
Fitness24Seven,Qwe 123,3,"Gym itself is good, but always crowded. So, better choose another branch of Fitness24seven."
Fitness24Seven,Jerry Lee Dormido,5,"I have my monthly subscription to Anytime Fitness, and I used to go to AF Nanglinchee. AF is not that far from my condo where I am staying for 2 months, but it was April and May, where the heat is too much to bear when I like using the Grab bike as it is fast and saves time. Thankfully, Fitness24seven offered a 2 month half price for the Songkran festival. I was so lucky as it is just 30 seconds away from my condo. It saved me time and money from taking Grab 5 days per week! Fitness24seven is fully equipped and very well maintained. It has a drinking station and clean shower room. The staff are always friendly as usual. And I don't need to have it canceled. When I applied for this 2 month promo deal, they ensured that it would be canceled after 2 months. And I received an email that my subscription ended hence. No hidden fees or wrong charges on my credit card. Great gym, great  service, great promo deal!!!"
Fitness24Seven,A New American Life ຊີວິດແບບອະເມຣິກາໃຫມ່,5,"Small, but nice gym. Has everything you need. 2,000 Baht a month membership gives you 24 hour access and to all of their locations."
Fitness24Seven,Tim Jones,5,"There are a couple guys on roids, one of them growls at people and throws the bench down when he moves it. 5/5 stars very entertaining

Kidding aside, I was here for a month and trained in the mornings. Paid 2,000 baht for a single month membership (no card, just cash). It can get quite busy and there is only one cable machine, so if you use that one a lot prepare to wait unless you come in off peak times.

Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Only negative I can think of is the lockers do stink of sweat when you open them (might need a deep clean). Overall would definitely sign up again if I came back, love training at this gym."
Fitness24Seven,Jordan King,5,"I’ve been bouncing around to a few gyms in Bangkok and this is my favorite! It’s never been too crowded and the weekly and monthly member rates are very affordable. Plenty of space with all you need including machines, free weights, and a club room for Zumba and Yoga. Staff are very friendly and helpful and create a nice atmosphere by really leaving you alone. Personal trainers available on request. Women also have a private gym area if they’d rather not hang around with the meat heads….but don’t be scared it’s just the money boys 😉"
Fitness24Seven,Romy Posse,5,"Tried it out today and I love it! The gym is huge, the equipment is top-notch, and they even have a women-only area, which is awesome.
Really happy with it!"
Fitness24Seven,Astin Panos,1,The gym and location are actually great. But it has a foul smell of poop and sewage as soon as you walk in the door that you can literally taste as your heavily breathing in and out the air during your whole workout. I’ve tried talking to the staff about this many times but given no answer. Due to this I must cancel my membership and not recommend to anyone else who may be bothered by the strong smell of fecal matter in the air. I believe it’s truly a health hazard.
Fitness24Seven,Kathy Conner,5,"Fitness24Seven on Nut is a fantastic gym. The membership prices are incredibly affordable, making it accessible for everyone. The gym is spacious, so I never feel crowded, even during peak hours. They have a great selection of high-quality equipment, from cardio machines to free weights, all in excellent condition. The atmosphere is welcoming, with friendly staff always available to help. Plus, the sense of community among members is motivating. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly gym with ample space and good equipment, I highly recommend Fitness24Seven!"
Fitness24Seven,Sergej Semibratov,5,"Great gym, not to crowded in the morning.
Staff is very kind and the temperature is perfect.

Would love if there would be a hack squat machine and a seated leg curl machine but you can’t have it all in life :)

Also some machines are in KG and others in LBS so some converting is to be done on the spot.

The price is not bad, I paid 5000baht for 3 months all in."

Fitness24Seven,Caffè Doppio,5,"2,000 a month for no contract is amazing! The gym itself is fully equipped. For a yearly subscription is only 1,299 a month or so. I wish they didn’t close the Summer Hills brunch as it was so close to my place.

The staffs are friendly and helpful. Overall I think this is an amazing gym and budget friendly."

Fitness24Seven Happyland,Alex Flips,1,"Only three benches. Remove the boxing pads and add more benches. Ridiculous.

One toilet. Yes one !

No barbells for curling."
Fitness24Seven Happyland,Luai Fattani,5,Good clean gym there is an employee her name mumtad she was kind and helpful.
Fitness24Seven Happyland,Mika Ceferina Salvador,5,"My favorite thing about this place is the staff. They are so friendly, helpful, and they always do their best to accommodate you. There are some equipment that are not available in this gym but they have the important ones and there’s enough space and it’s not suffocating like the branch in Rama 9.
I just hope they would put more notice saying something along the lines of “Do not sit here just to use your phones. Leave the bench if you’re done working out.” 😂 It’s just annoying to see people just sitting with their phones for more than 5 minutes while others are waiting for them to finish. Honestly.
And if you’re a customer reading this, PLEASE don’t occupy the seats too long especially during busy hours. 🙏🏻"

Also the vending machine doesn’t work or is always empty.

Also there are people who just sit at the table and study with a laptop. I didn’t know this was a free study area, it’s a gym."

If you like it cool, play in the air-conditioned zone. The other zone has fans. There are shower rooms and parking is very convenient. It's on the 2nd floor of Building A in the Jas Green Village Khubon shopping center. Downstairs is a Tops Supermarket ♥️ There's also a Jones Salad shop. If you're hungry after exercising, there's a lot to eat. 💚"
Fitness 7 kubon,RIGHTNOWPHOTO,5,"Open 24 hours, lots of quality equipment.
Monthly 1,600 baht *No entry fee
Membership fee 100 baht
There are both air-conditioned and heated zones. It's a very large gym."
Fitness 7 kubon,Shizuka Indy,5,"Fitness open 24 hours in Jas Green Village.
Come play at any time, very convenient.
Lots of toys  There are divided into hot zones and air conditioned zones. The place is spacious. During prime time, that is, in the evening, there will be a lot of people especially.

Highlights - As far as playing Well, we don't focus on selling trainers here. But if you want to train one-on-one. There are courses to choose from, not expensive, market prices similar to other places. Trainers don't bother, they don't sell courses, they let people play freely. This is really very good.

Promotion - depends on the month. According to the picture below, there may be changes. Recommend calling to inquire. Or come and see the actual place.

Parking - plenty, but during lunchtime and evening when people come to eat. It will be difficult to find parking.

The point that I think could be improved would be even better is the cleanliness of the bathrooms and shower rooms. Some rooms are not very clean and damaged.  If it is completely repaired, it will be very good."
Fitness 7 kubon,sorakit napasuppakarn,1,"The hot zone treadmills are all broken. There has been no running for a month. Why does Nam only accept cash? These days, very few people carry cash. Let me think about it."
Fitness 7 Town In Town,Clems G,4,"Overall:
This Fitness 7 gym outlet is nice to visit if you stay in the area, as it is not hard to find and not expensive to buy their gym membership.
While some of my comments below might be a bit nit-picky, I still enjoyed gymming here as they have most of the basic/expected gym equipment you can find at commercial gyms like Anytime Fitness.

-----

Good:
- relatively affordable prices (vs Anytime Fitness gyms) (check their website and convert to your currency accordingly)
- opens 24/7 (unsure if staff stays beyond 7 PM)
- not crowded (mid-day, evening)
- indoor + outdoor areas (gym users can choose which environment they want to exercise in, to meet their desired goals)
- indoor boxing ring (can still practice boxing during rainy days)
- numerous cardio machines (indoor + outdoor areas)

OK:
- indoor lighting:
Looks cool but is a bit dim, makes it feel a bit sleepy.
- general ventilation:
Indoor a/c keeps the gym environment dry and cool enough to exercise in, and there are some fans at various corners of the gym (both indoor + outdoor areas). However, the fans can sometimes be inadequate depending on which area the fans are placed at (ie, if there is no fan around you, it can get warm/hot pretty quickly).

Not So Good:
- general cleanliness/tidiness:
Gym accessories (yoga mat, various handles for cable machine, etc) do not have a designated area to be placed/returned to after use.
Gym users also generally do not return/remove the accessories/dumbbells/weight plates after use.
While there are a few cleaning solutions placed around the gym, gym users generally do not wipe down the equipment after use (nor use a towel during their exercise).
- equipment condition:
Some machines are rusty and difficult to adjust (due to rust).
(Eg, rusty metal dumbbell grips)
(Eg, difficult to adjust the pins for the seat at the ""Seated Leg Curl"" machine)
Some equipment (benches) are not heavy and/or lack rubber footing, which causes them to be unstable and shift midway during your exercise."
Fitness 7 Town In Town,Pakawat Wisesmanee,3,Old machines & some machines are broken or too light- especially for back training!!

Fitness 7 Town In Town,Thanapong Veenin,5,Gym is very clean and nice.
Fitness 7 Town In Town,watcharin kongcharoen,4,"dailt rate is quite high. Night time exercise is good, not crowded"
Fitness 7 Srinakarin,Alex Flips,1,I’ve never seen any cleaning I’ve been there a month. Half of the equipment is broken. Dust coming through from building work. Benches are not adjustable. Staff use the machines when it should be customers first (we are paying for the gym!!). The treadmills stop for no reason. Yoga mats are too thin. Not enough fasteners to keep the weights on the bar. I can’t wait to leave.
Fitness 7 Srinakarin,Saran Amonloetphaiwong,1,"First Time here and i can tell right away that is place is not been taking care of at all. The toilet and the equipment are old&dirty&broken
I've been to a few local Gym in Bangkok
And this one is a no more for me
The price is not bad but for the quality that you get in here is not worth the price
Some other gyms are a little bit cheaper but the quality that  you get it's totally different
Can't wait to leave here even if it's the nearest gym around me"
Fitness 7 Srinakarin,Edmund Bagnulo,5,"Great place.  Nice people.  No bros.  Barely ever crowded, even at peak.  Nice staff (no hablan Ingles).  Good equipment.  Great price."

Fitness 7,Kahala,3,"Very nice gym, the boxing area is great. The issue I have is it is very expensive for a day pass, 350 bhat. On top of that, although it is marketed as a day pass, you are not allowed to return after one session even in the same day just a few hours later. I think it would be worth it for a month, but I would not return for a day pass."
Fitness 7,Esther Kooistra,4,"Nice gym with all the equipment you need, friendly people, and it is not too crowded. Only one of the rooms has an A/C, but you can find already quite some equipment for all body parts in that room. Day pass costs 350 baht. You can find the gym on the second floor of the building"

Fitness 7,Kiatirat Apiratanawong,4,"OK place for the price. 1500/month,  have a/c zone, hot zone (they walled the car park area to do this). Enough equipments. Not crawed during the day.

Hot zone is hot, but not too bad. Not sure on Summer though. Locker is in hot zone.

Locker has no A/C so no good for shower and going out.

Park your car until everything done w/ out worry parking cost."
Anytime Fitness Lotus SARABURI,Leo Sangadej,5,Looks great! they said they are set to open on the 16th of June
Anytime Fitness Lotus SARABURI,TKhun1daytrip,5,"🏪Open 24 hours
🏙️Conveniently located in the city center
🤼❌Peak hours are after work from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM. Crowds of people scramble to use the cardio machines. The weights zone is still open (it could be expanded in the future).
✅Off-peak hours are every morning.
🙂Saturdays and Sundays are less crowded than weekdays.
🥤Bring your own water bottle. There's a hot and cold water dispenser.
🗄️Lockers are available. Bring your own key and locker.
🛁3 men's shower rooms and 1 toilet (I think it's too small). No separate urinals.
💨Gym atmosphere
Classroom: I thought the front room would be bigger. There's no stage for instructors, so people behind you might not be able to see.

Anytime Fitness Lotus SARABURI,102 Naruebet Hokpunna,5,"There are few treadmills and too few exercise machines. I can't imagine coming in the evening and having to wait for a treadmill.
However, the equipment is modern, the fitness center is clean, and it's great that it's open 24 hours, the only one in Saraburi. It's perfect for those who like to exercise in the morning."

This time there’s an African jungle theme with rare birds and animals."

Anytime Fitness Oasis Ratchapruek,Steven R Ankers,5,Wow. What a beautiful gym
Anytime Fitness Oasis Ratchapruek,AMATA,1,"Crowded, noisy, and terrible management. During class, a woman likes to spread out her mats (yoga and body balance classes) even though the space is very small. She's so rude. People leave space for their arms and legs, but she shamelessly takes the already very little space left and moves into her own spot. Not only that, she calls her own friends to join her, but the staff doesn't even bother. And when the crowd starts to build up, the staff tells them to move instead of telling the person who's already in line to go behind them. This is terrible management. Have the staff at this branch received any training? Plus, the trainers yell at her in an extremely rude manner. The bathrooms are incredibly dirty, with hair all over the sink. It makes me want to vomit!

—————

Manners come first!
I know there's a lot of space left in the crowd, so share it. Kindness is important, but don't cut in like this!!! Even though there's so much space left in the back. You have to consider whether this behavior is polite before asking for kindness.
I'm not saying I won't share, but there's so much space left in the back, but she's cutting in even though she arrived later and there's already so little space left. ""It's too much to say that there's no space left at all. And then you claim you're being inconsiderate. Isn't that weird? Shouldn't you have manners first? Then you ask for kindness, then you call your friends to cut in, even though there's plenty of space left behind. Why would you cut in? You can review the CCTV footage, and then you'll tell others to move. Be mindful!! Public gyms should also have manners, not just because there are too many people! Don't tell people to go to a private gym. That's sick logic. Public gyms should have manners. And body balance/yoga classes require you to spread your arms and legs. Ask the instructor about that. Or are you supposed to hit each other in the face with your legs? That's ridiculous. What kind of logic are you using? You should think with your brains whether public gym etiquette is appropriate for this class. You should re-evaluate yourself and improve. Or if you want to be clear, get the CCTV footage and share it with others to see if this public gym etiquette is appropriate!!!""

***P.S. 1) Manners and consideration for fellow classmates/public gym members are essential, as this is not a private space. Everyone pays to use public facilities.

2) When you come to a public gym, public manners should come first. This isn't about fighting with Cambodians, where competition is a constant issue when crowded.

3) Staff management should be in place, and there should be clear rules and regulations for those who don't understand gym etiquette and public classes.

4) No one just walks into the gym and spreads their arms and legs. This is about entering the class and following the instructor's instructions, which require space and distance between exercises and poses. Class participants should know this well. No one wants to spread their arms and legs and hit their friends in the face. Therefore, it's important to maintain proper distance while stretching and following the instructor's poses.

5) This is an exercise class, and it's normal for people to spread their arms and legs and stretch. This isn't a meditation class. This is a public class, not a private class. Etiquette is a must, and it's not about telling others to go private. That's a bit strange.

5) Before you judge someone's mindset, please consider their logic, behavior, and manners toward their fellow classmates and the public gym. Who should see a doctor?"
Anytime Fitness Oasis Ratchapruek,Mc Snoopy,2,"It's true. The people at this branch don't seem very nice. They seem to have very little manners when using the public gym. It's not like a paid gym. It's like working out in a public subdistrict administrative organization area, where it's extremely loud and you have to fight for space when entering class. It's very intimidating. They have no consideration for their classmates who have arrived earlier, and their manners are quite poor. Instead of improving their manners, they think they're already good. This is really strange logic. Anyone who comes to this branch should fight for space, lol. They have no manners and don't know what proper etiquette is for using the gym (public area).

P.S. The bathrooms are really dirty."
Portobello Mall Sriracha,Roger Manz,5,GREAT JOYCE
Portobello Mall Sriracha,vasudev avalakki,5,Good place for shopping
Portobello Mall Sriracha,อานันท์ พุทธรักษา,3,"It's a small plaza with five 7-Elevens and one store. There are three restaurants: a noodle shop called Tom La Yum, a somtam shop called Tam Kaset, and a shabu-sushi buffet called Shabu House, starting at 299, 499, and 599. There are also three coffee and beverage shops (Ochaya Amazon and others).
There's also one massage shop, one dental clinic, one hair salon, one drugstore (Pharmacist Suthipong), and one flower shop.
There's limited parking, with only 26 spaces. Parking is free for two hours, and 20 baht per hour after that. It's not enough for most people, so it's only a good place to stop by. There's a KFC drive-thru in front."
Portobello Mall Sriracha,Referred P,1,"The sign is very dark. The sign is on Saturday in front of 7-Eleven. There are not many customers and the parking lot is not available. So I parked in front of 7-Eleven because there are CCTV cameras. Importantly, I parked for less than 15 minutes. I just went up to get something at my brother's condo and got fined 200 baht. The security guard said that I can't park like that. It doesn't matter if it's not more than 15 minutes because I parked and went up to the condo. My brother happened to be staying at a famous hotel nearby. (The sign didn't say that parking and going up to the condo was prohibited.)"

And the middle class does not have a glass partition, there is no place to take off shoes, and people like to take off their shoes and put them inside, which is ugly. When playing the class, they stick their shoes, it looks impolite and there is no organization. The cleaning lady does not come to mop the floor after class, it looks dirty, not like the The Walk branch. After class, the cleaning lady comes to mop the floor before starting the next class all the time."

Anytime Fitness JLK Tower,Kenny Yap,4,"Really small space, the rack area is super cramped especially and doesn’t have enough benches. Dumbbells only go up to 36kg in 2kg intervals.

One upside is that there are ski erg and row erg machines and everything feels very new. I’m still thankful for these outlets nonetheless. Hoping there will be more AF opening up in Bangkok, especially since it’s pretty popular among locals."
Anytime Fitness JLK Tower,su sirirak,5,"Good location which you can walk straight from the BTS, Nice staff who will be advised you if you don’t know how to use machine."
Anytime Fitness JLK Tower,issaree nokngam,5,"The gym is open 24 hours and fully equipped with all the necessary facilities. Although the space is a bit limited, it offers a complete range of exercise machines. The staff are friendly and provide excellent service. The personal trainers are knowledgeable, offering helpful advice on workouts and effective weight management plans. On weekdays after 6 PM, it tends to get crowded, but it’s nicely quiet and manageable on weekends. Overall, it’s a solid gym.

One suggestion: during group classes, the speaker volume can sometimes be too loud, which disrupts individual training or workouts. It would be great if the speaker volume could be better controlled."
Anytime Fitness JLK Tower,lainezopx,1,Incredibly a bad staff there who was talking negatively and unprofessionally to a client. The place seems well-equipped but services (from one of them) was horrible and lame.
Anytime Fitness Exchange Tower,Kenny Yap,4,"Very nice place to train for hyrox. Theres ski erg, rows, wallballs with targets, no sandbag for lunges for 20kg and above but there’s the bars available for 20kg. Plenty of kettlebells as well if you wanna do FC. Weight wise the setup isn’t the best if you’re looking to do deadlift or squats as there’s no mirror to check your form.

Dumbbell free weight area is also quite small and weight is only up to 30kg. Not the best shaped dumbbells as well due to the bulky diameters.

The cardio machines are super sleek and new though, all techno gym brand. There are also classes in the evenings as well and pretty popular, I didn’t join any but it looks like a free to join on the spot kind.

There are also some tables at the entrance where you can eat at. Plenty of showering area but toilets are outside which can be troublesome."
Anytime Fitness Exchange Tower,Ba Tengchongdee,5,"Probably the biggest AF downtown Bangkok. Been a member since day 1 and seeing some improvements. Gym keeps adding more machines and classes. Staff are friendly and busy but feel free to ask for assists.

Bathroom and changing rooms aren't ideal - they are located quite apart so somwtimes I have to put on clothes on wet floor or get dressed quickly in the open area. Toilet is located outside the gym - good for the odor but a bit inconvenient.

Lockers are quite the issue here. Try not to use the pin as it might not unlock your locker. Gym knows the issue and asks to bring your own padlock.

I like Technogym and crowDJ system used in the gym where you can log your workout and request your favorite songs.

Location is best - 4th floor Exchange Tower. Gym provides free 2 hours parking. There is a skywalk from BTS Asok connected to the building. Although the building's main entrances are closed after 10pm -  you can use the entrance aside the parking exit to get in the building late night. I feel safe enough as there are 24 hour security guards around.

Highly recommended to expats or gymgoers who have flexible workout times and locations. ❤️❤️❤️"

Since the space isn’t very large, it can get a bit crowded during peak hours on weekday —similar to others. Off-peak hours and weekend are much more chill and relaxed. The only con is that the restrooms are outside the gym.

Overall, it’s a convenient place for workout."
Anytime Fitness Exchange Tower,Babybeny,4,"This gym is amazing (even if it’s quite small spaces, especially during the peak time at the weightlifting area) but they have the top equipment from Technogym, e.g., treadmills, elliptical, weight machines, dumbbells, etc.

The staff are friendly and helpful, making the gym environment feel welcoming.

Beyond the equipment and staff, the gym's location is very conveniently located in the heart of Bangkok. Just few steps from skytrain. Easy to access!

However, I notice that the locker rooms could be improved in term of cleanliness and maintenance. And I think it could need some more!"
Anytime Fitness นางลิ้นจี่,Principal 23 Studio,5,"This is by far my favorite gym!

It doesn’t need to be fancy, what matters is the quality, and this place delivers. With its size, it’s impressive how the gym manages to pack in every type of equipment for training every single muscle group. 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼

That’s because the owner, K Evan, truly loves what he does, and it shows. He clearly knows his craft 👍🏼👍🏼

The gym is exceptionally well maintained. All the equipment is always in great condition. I’ve never seen anything broken or out of service for more than a week. They take real care of everything here.👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

Extra credit goes to the cleanliness, the warm and super professional staffs and the PT that make you feel right at home 😉😘

I was already considering canceling my membership because of the lack of equipment in my city. But since I travel a lot anyway, I will keep it for now. My favorite part are the monkey bars, still rings, and climbing area. I wish all anytime fitness has the same equipments. Awesome gym here. I'm extremely satisfied. Near silom area."
Anytime Fitness นางลิ้นจี่,mark stoddart,5,"Despite my love of local gyms, I do own a Anytime Fitness international membership.

I like to get start early, so the global 24hr access is perfect for when I'm at home and travelling.

The great thing about this club, and the others I have been to is, they are independtly owned, so they do have that vibe and feeling of a local club.

Machines, layout and facilities are fairly standard across the different gyms, so you have a good idea what to expect.

This Anytime actually had some great HIIT step ups including a dedicated area with TRX straps and other equipment.

The PT/Staff were friendly but left me to train, which I love.

Very clean facilities and machines which was nice.

Given cost and access, I think the Anytime membership is great value.

I thought the real photos of how to use the machines was a nice touch."
Anytime Fitness นางลิ้นจี่,Alex,5,"A relatively small, but well equipped gym. Dumbbells top out at 50kg, which is a rarity in Thailand. Functional exercise area was a bonus, as were the multiple belts, weight attachments and various appendages available to do your favourite exercises. We were asked not to make too much noise and we didn’t have any trouble just having a normal heavy push sesh."
Anytime Fitness นางลิ้นจี่,Younes Bounoua,5,"I had the pleasure of training at this outstanding facility during my stay in Bangkok.

However, now the contract is extended indefinitely, which is not what I agreed to in the first place. The staff seems impossible to reach - Neither official website channels, Instagram, Line, nor email works! What now? Should I fly back to Thailand to sort out credit card bookings of a contract that should have automatically ended? Extremely unprofessional behavior and an absolute no-go. Take care and do not trust them to handle the contract on your behalf. Do prepaid and nothing else!"
Anytime Fitness - Century Onnut,SEO神,3,"It's a welcome addition in a good location, in what used to be a home appliance store. The staff are very nice. There's an adequate lineup of equipment and weights, but there could be a lot more and the space could be better thought out. Especially considering that it's new.

Fans are blasting, blowing everything around, including the paper towels for cleaning the equipment (which very few people seem to do). Users leave things lying around and don't rack their plates. More guidance on manners is needed. The staff seem indifferent to it.

People calling it ""very small"" aren't being fair and haven't gotten around much. Maybe they're comparing it against Western gyms. It's actually quite spacious.

The cleaning liquid seems to be some kind of industrial cleaner; no wonder it's not used much. Music is way too loud, whether it's the overhead or a class in session. Hopefully, the Anytime Fitness chain will impart some best practices and help this outlet use the space better and clean up more. Still glad to see Anytime making its footprint in Thailand because more competition is needed."

This is really strange logic. Anyone who comes to this branch should fight for space, lol. They have no manners and don't know what proper etiquette is for using the gym (public area).

P.S. The bathrooms are really dirty."
Anytime Fitness นางลิ้นจี่,Principal 23 Studio,5,"This is by far my favorite gym!

It doesn’t need to be fancy, what matters is the quality, and this place delivers. With its size, it’s impressive how the gym manages to pack in every type of equipment for training every single muscle group. 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼

That’s because the owner, K Evan, truly loves what he does, and it shows. He clearly knows his craft 👍🏼👍🏼

The gym is exceptionally well maintained. All the equipment is always in great condition. I’ve never seen anything broken or out of service for more than a week. They take real care of everything here.👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

Extra credit goes to the cleanliness, the warm and super professional staffs and the PT that make you feel right at home 😉😘

Anytime Fitness นางลิ้นจี่,Jerry Lee Dormido,5,"Has more equipment than anytime fitness in my city (Angeles City, Philippines). I was already considering canceling my membership because of the lack of equipment in my city. But since I travel a lot anyway, I will keep it for now. My favorite part are the monkey bars, still rings, and climbing area. I wish all anytime fitness has the same equipments. Awesome gym here. I'm extremely satisfied. Near silom area."
Anytime Fitness นางลิ้นจี่,mark stoddart,5,"Despite my love of local gyms, I do own a Anytime Fitness international membership.

I like to get start early, so the global 24hr access is perfect for when I'm at home and travelling.

The great thing about this club, and the others I have been to is, they are independtly owned, so they do have that vibe and feeling of a local club.

Machines, layout and facilities are fairly standard across the different gyms, so you have a good idea what to expect.

This Anytime actually had some great HIIT step ups including a dedicated area with TRX straps and other equipment.

The PT/Staff were friendly but left me to train, which I love.

Very clean facilities and machines which was nice.

Given cost and access, I think the Anytime membership is great value.

I thought the real photos of how to use the machines was a nice touch."
Anytime Fitness นางลิ้นจี่,Alex,5,"A relatively small, but well equipped gym. Dumbbells top out at 50kg, which is a rarity in Thailand. Functional exercise area was a bonus, as were the multiple belts, weight attachments and various appendages available to do your favourite exercises. We were asked not to make too much noise and we didn’t have any trouble just having a normal heavy push sesh."
Anytime Fitness นางลิ้นจี่,Younes Bounoua,5,"I had the pleasure of training at this outstanding facility during my stay in Bangkok. The owner, Evan, spent over an hour teaching me proper kettlebell techniques and perfecting my deadlift. I've never experienced coaching like this before. I can't recommend this gym enough! The staff is friendly, and the gym is well-equipped (better than my own city)."
