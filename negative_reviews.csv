Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Gateway Bang Sue,Kyllian Kailo,2,Don‚Äôt bother with this location. Has mostly people that just sit in equipment and play on their phone. Can take you a couple hours to get a workout done. Other locations less crowded and seem to have people that want to work out. Feel like I should get a refund on my membership since I can‚Äôt use the machines. Everyone busy on Facebook and tik tok. This person sit like this for over 20 minutes. I want to use and ask. But he won‚Äôt move
Jetts 24 Hour Fitness Gateway Bang Sue,Naphat H,1,"A male trainer with blue hair at Jetts bang Sue was rude to me

Jetts Black - The PARQ,Arnanthithi Na Srito,2,"I was there yesterday for the free trial at approximately 5:30pm.
Overall I wasn't happy with the experience at all.
1. The reception who took me didn't even show me around. Gave me a towel told me where the changing room was and yep that's it.
2. There was not enough lockers at all. I had to put my gym back in a cubby.
3. 90% of the machines had hoggers on them. Just sitting there taking their 5-10 minutes of rest in between sets.
4. There was not enough weight plates making it hard to do actual workouts on freeweights.
5. There was a queue even for the drinking water.
6. The first toilet/shower I went in to change into my gym clothes was fine, however the second one that I weight to change back was so smelly I nearly puked and decided to just skip the shower and go home.

So my final ratings is a 2/5. What could've been a 40-45 minutes work out lasted almost an hour because of the small hassles. And honestly speaking if I had to pay a bit more to use a disgusting toilet I rather just pay a cheaper price to not shower. I'll be heading to Jetts black One bangkok in a few days and see how the experience is there."
Jetts Black - The PARQ,KT,1,Lockers and toilets are never enough during peak hours. I have been there a few times and I always have to leave because of this issue. Which is really upsetting.

Jetts Black Park Silom,Joao Campos,1,"Yesterday, I signed up for a 3-month membership at Jetts 24-Hour Gym. Today, I went to Jetts Black in Park Silom at 19:35 PM to upgrade my membership. I had my gym gear and was ready to work out. I spoke with the staff on duty, requesting an upgrade which i was already ready to pay the difference in price. The staff contacted the manager named ""Got"", who informed them that upgrades could only be processed the next day, which meant I couldn't work out.

I politely asked if could be possible to workout today and enrol tomorrow offering a deposit, but they said I wasn't allowed to enter the gym. Essentially, I was kicked out. I definitely won't be returning to this Jetts Black.

This manager named ""GOT"" shouldn't be working on customer service."

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Unilever House,Taweerat Kairaskulapat,2,"The gym is not bad overall, but it gets extremely crowded during peak hours (5-8 P.M.), making it hard to get a proper workout.

On top of that, there are no towels available, which raises hygiene concerns since people sweat heavily in this heat.

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Robinson Lifestyle Latkrabang,Eren Yƒ±lmaz,1,"Dear management,
I signed for 3 months contract with my overseas bank account. After my first month I needed to go to my country urgently but before that I wanted to come to the gym and I couldn‚Äôt go in. After a while I realized next payment didn‚Äôt go through and I didn‚Äôt know that. Because of I couldn‚Äôt go into the gym I didn‚Äôt get any information. I was expecting to receive a call from gym management because they have pictures of my bank card in their system and I could do freeze my account and go to my own country.

So what happened now. After the payment issue I thought okay then which means my gym membership is gone, I went to glass bangna branch for create a membership but they told me I have to pay for 3 months now. I said no one didn‚Äôt call me and when I realised it was too late for me to take an action. They said we will call Robinson branch for give you a call yesterday but no one also didn‚Äôt call me.

I‚Äôm a foreigner in this country I don‚Äôt know how the entire system is works but I lived in two different countries for a long time when some issue is appear I always receive a call but I didn‚Äôt get anything in Robinson Jett‚Äôs fitness branch.

On the first day I came to apply, many people gave me annoying and unfriendly looks. The manager who applied did not have any manners. It is not surprising that many trainers lack basic manners. The manager came on the first day and was told if his father came with him today when he went to apply for a fitness fee because it would sell training courses. When we told him to try a trial first, it seemed like there was nothing but that was enough. I tried to finish it again and this time I avoided it by asking the caller to ask at home first and he said again that he was calling his mother. That is, not very polite when speaking. I've never seen this before. Many trainers don't have much manners, they look bad and are very narrow. I once walked across a trainer and didn't dodge for a bit, collided with each other and didn't even bother to apologize to the person wearing trainers. The housekeeper first came but was not very good. Sweeping and rubbing in the locker row didn't look like she was going to be in trouble. Many people who play here are strange about placing things on the seat because they are doing PT. As for it coming later, I put it first and it wanted to put it later. It's a matter of the spine, but when we went to sit and rest nearby, it turned and looked at us like it was after a cheap water bottle. Even though we sat down and sat down to rest first and were not satisfied, we didn't have to put it down later and it would still be a big deal. All in all, many things were not impressive."

Jetts 24 Hour Fitness - Central Nakhon Pathom,Sorada Somwan,2,"Wanted to use the new model of measuring device at Jett Fitness, which requires a staff member to measure, so waited until 8:00 a.m., which is the staff working hours, but no one was available to provide service because the trainers were all busy with personal customers and no other staff member was available to take care of them.

Even though they knew that the equipment required staff, there was no one ready to provide service, making them wait for an hour and a half or come back the next day.

On Saturdays and Sundays when there are a lot of customers, there should be a clearer staff assignment because this is a basic service that customers expect. They should give importance to all customers, not just those who pay for personal training.

The equipment is modern, the gym is clean, but the service management still needs improvement."

WE Fitness Ekkamai,Matthew Raab,1,"Where to begin with this gym?  When you first walk in you'll be greeted by some robots.  Then you'll encounter a bunch of trainers standing around awkwardly trying to intimidate you into purchasing personal training.  It becomes clear that it's the business model to over hire personal trainers as they make the most money this way to a point where there are so many trainers they can outnumber customers at the gym.

Bottom line is that many people are leaving this gym because this gym doesn't care about you but instead only trying to squeeze more money from you.  Think carefully before engaging in a contract."

Fitness First Zone Central World,Eric Siritiraset,1,"So far the worst experience of being in a fitness club. Some of the club members are extremely rude to others as if manner wasn't taught in his school, so uneducated. And, what's worse is that, when reported, there is no action taken from the staff and the club Manager. Clearly, the staff don't seem to care about their current members at all (see how the experience shifted once they trick you to sign that contract full of ambiguous wordings with them). Instead, they are being greedy and want to hunt for the new ones all the time. Pathetic!"

So, you‚Äôll very likely pay a minimum of 2 additional months. If you press them hard, they ask you to cancel your credit card (absolutely ridiculous!!!).

I escalated my appeal to the management team. They refused to reimburse me and never contacted me back, even when promised. I was forced to deal with the situation through my credit card company.

However, the air conditioning in the cardio area has been inoperative for an extended period, and the lack of urgency in addressing this issue is somewhat disappointing.

However, due to the high density of residential properties in the vicinity, peak hours‚Äîparticularly in the evening‚Äîresult in excessive overcrowding, significantly diminishing the training experience.

For serious lifters, the facility is likely to prove inadequate. The gym provides only a single squat rack, an oversight that severely limits strength training efficiency. Additionally, the absence of a plate-loaded leg press machine further restricts lower-body development options. The barbells available are not standard Olympic models, deviating from the conventional 20kg (45lbs) specification, which may pose an inconvenience to those accustomed to competition-grade equipment.

The overall atmosphere lacks the intensity found in more strength-focused environments, as the majority of patrons prioritize general fitness over hypertrophy or powerlifting objectives. A notable observation is the prevalence of underdeveloped lower bodies among male gym-goers, indicative of an apparent neglect of leg training‚Äîan unfortunate yet all-too-common phenomenon.

Furthermore, the excessive presence of so-called ‚Äútrainers‚Äù clad in red polo shirts monopolizing machines and training areas exacerbates the issue. Many of these individuals appear ill-equipped to provide effective strength training guidance, as evidenced by their own inability to perform fundamental lifts at a respectable level‚Äîsuch as a 315lb squat or a 225lb bench press. Consequently, for those dedicated to serious strength progression, this gym falls markedly short of expectations."

1.	The staff didn‚Äôt provide any useful information about the gym facilities and repeatedly referred to me as ‚Äú‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏π,‚Äù which felt unprofessional and condescending.
2.	Many of the equipment areas, especially the dumbbell section, are poorly maintained. The dumbbells are old, and the floor in front of them is uneven and potentially hazardous.
3.	Most concerning of all, one of only two fire exits on the entire floor is blocked by a deadlift station ‚Äî an extremely unsafe and unacceptable setup.

I would not recommend this gym."

Virgin Active Empire Tower,Sukhum Cheff Truengtrachitkul,3,"The gym is massive, spanning three floors with facilities like a pool and Pilates studio. The overall vibe is luxurious with grey tones, but it feels a bit gloomy, like it‚Äôs always about to rain. I attended a Grid class, and while the program and instructor were great at motivating members to hit their calorie goals, the music was a letdown. Despite being ‚Äòlicensed,‚Äô it felt like generic free music from SoundCloud newbies‚Äîbland, uncreative, and forgettable. No catchy lyrics, no energy, just a dull mix that doesn‚Äôt match the premium feel of the gym. Why not invest in real music from Warner or Sony? It‚Äôs a shame because it undermines an otherwise solid class. Other areas of the gym also feel outdated, like watching Fashion TV from the early 2000s. Not sure I‚Äôll be back for classes until they improve the atmosphere."
Virgin Active EmQuartier,Ster nio,2,"if you have signed up for the 50% off promotion on first 6 billings be aware of your payments.

in my case 3 out of first 5 billings they were charging the full price.

i had to go everytime to the counter to resolve the issue only for it to happen again at next billing, very annoying. I went to the gym 4-5 times per week and they told me that you only get the promotion after checking in 2 times every week but they had problems last month with the check-in. (btw. this wasn‚Äòt even mentioned to me nor my friend who signed up on a different day)

so even if you go there a lot and are eligble for the promotion (like in my case) they are not charging the right amounts, the managment told me the IT department said i wasnt the only member with this issue, so every member should be aware.

Even with all this trouble and time i had to waste at the counter there is no compensation for it, they just told me they will cancel the next payment so i get the money back i paid too much so far.

its a shame because i like the gym and the facilities a lot"

Fitness24Seven,Earl Lancast,1,"There is a sign at the desk saying no staff from 5-6.  It is now 6:13 and still no staff.  I guess no one works here.  Totally garbage if you are traveling and want to train.  Pick any of the other gyms near here. They can actually staff their counter.  I would love to meet the employee that can‚Äôt make it work after their break, but they may never show up.  June 27th 6:15pm. Thanks for ruining my chance to train, I hope you get fired."
Fitness24Seven,Fung tana,2,"I'd like to deduct points for the restroom. It smells as pungent as a temple toilet, and it's bitter to the throat. I understand the ventilation system may not be good. We should urgently adjust our measures. Clean more often, use deodorizer, and increase the number of cleanings. A gym this new shouldn't be this pungent. We need to make improvements ASAP."

Classroom: I thought the front room would be bigger. There's no stage for instructors, so people behind you might not be able to see.
The room is very hot compared to outside, as there's only one air conditioner. Even a fan won't help much.

Portobello Mall Sriracha,Referred P,1,"The sign is very dark. The sign is on Saturday in front of 7-Eleven. There are not many customers and the parking lot is not available. So I parked in front of 7-Eleven because there are CCTV cameras. Importantly, I parked for less than 15 minutes. I just went up to get something at my brother's condo and got fined 200 baht. The security guard said that I can't park like that. It doesn't matter if it's not more than 15 minutes because I parked and went up to the condo. My brother happened to be staying at a famous hotel nearby. (The sign didn't say that parking and going up to the condo was prohibited.)"
Anytime Fitness Lotus Bangyai,AMATA,2,"This branch is very small, crowded, there are only shower rooms, no toilets, very confusing, have to walk to the mall very far, plus there is no hand soap, even more confusing. And the middle class does not have a glass partition, there is no place to take off shoes, and people like to take off their shoes and put them inside, which is ugly. When playing the class, they stick their shoes, it looks impolite and there is no organization. The cleaning lady does not come to mop the floor after class, it looks dirty, not like the The Walk branch. After class, the cleaning lady comes to mop the floor before starting the next class all the time."
Anytime Fitness JLK Tower,lainezopx,1,Incredibly a bad staff there who was talking negatively and unprofessionally to a client. The place seems well-equipped but services (from one of them) was horrible and lame.
